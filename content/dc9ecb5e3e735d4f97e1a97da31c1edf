<img src="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/i/sony-mdr-v6.gif" height="180" width="148" align="right" hspace="4"/>

In 1995 I first tried on a pair of Sony MDR-V6 headphones.  I was working as a full-time Unix sysadmin (for co-op credit) in the <a href="http://www.bgsu.edu/departments/compsci/">Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href="http://www.bgsu.edu/">BGSU</a> and my supervisor had a pair that he loaned me for a day.  I was so impressed that I bought a pair the next day and it's still the only model of full-sized headphones that I buy.</p>

<p>The price has come down quite a bit since then.  They can be had <a href="http://shopping.yahoo.com/search?p=Sony+MDR-V6">on Yahoo Shopping</a> for less than $75 in a few stores.  If you try Amazon, you'll find that they're currently not in stock (and seem not to be most of the time).</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I ordered two more of these.  I wanted a newer pair for work and a pair for home as well.  The ones I had at work were showing their nearly 10 years of age but still sounded excellent.</p>

<h4>What's to Like?</h4>

<ul>

<li>foam padded earpieces that cover your whole ear and block out ambient noise</li>
<li>padded headpiece</li>
<li>1/4" stereo adaptor included</li>
<li>excellent frequency response (the highs are clear and the lows are powerful)</li>
<li>the size adjustment mechanism works well and holds up over time</li>
<li>very long cord that never seems to lose its spring</li>

</ul>

<p>If you're in the market for a set of full-size stereo headphones, I highly recommend the Sony MDR-V6 headphones.  It's a proven design that's been on the market for at least 9 years now.</p>

<p>I'm seriously considering another pair just to have on hand 10 years from now when I need a replacement.</p>

<p>They're okay...but if you use them heavily, the leatherette covers will tear from the phones. HD 580s are great for a quiet environment, or go etymotic for noisier environments.</p>

<p>Back in BGSU (working in the CS department as a graduate assistant) I was loyal to Sony Headphones. Matter of fact, till upto last year. Once I discovered Bose's Acoustic Noise Cancelling headphones, I haven't looked back. Rated highly by magazines but more importantly, when I put them on at a Bose store, I didn't want to take them off. Cost the same as my iPod but the best accessory hands down.</p>

<p>If you want to replace the pads, you can get the Beyerdynamic DT250 velour/velvet pads. They are a lot more comfortable than the pleather IMO and fit almost perfectly on the Sony's. It's a popular mod at various headphone sites.</p>

<p>I own both the Sony MDR-V6s and Sennheiser 580s.<br />
I use them both almost interchangably with the only differences being that the Sony offers better isolation and the Sennheiser slightly more transparent highs. And, since the Sony folds, it's more convenient when travelling. But I wouldn't throw either one out of bed. Both are great 'phones.</p>

<p>By far the best headphones I've ever owned.<br />
I bought these in the mid 90's after reading a Stereophile B class rating. For the price they should be in the A+ class. These headphones are perfect in every tone level, clear and tight bass, very clear midrange and airy highs.<br />
THERE JUST ITSN'T ANYTHING BETTER AT THIS PRICE.</p>

<p>The V6s and 7506s are the same headphones with different connectors (the 7506s are gold).  The V600s and V900s are inferior.</p>

<p>I've had, I think, 3 pairs of these since '89. They always get stolen. My favorite headphones.. I've had   pretty decent production budgets in the past and have bought ~$600 Sennheiser and AKG. I always come back to the v6.</p>

<p>I like a little extra bass, in a mix and as a consumer, and a little 50hz notch keeps me from overdoing it.</p>

<p>If you like a flatter frequency response, try the v7.</p>

<p>It's true that the earpads fall apart. This prevented me from using my v-6s for about 6 years now. (I bought them for $100 in 1989) Luckily my friend gave me a pair of audio-technica phones. On a whim I decided to see if the pads fit. Eureka! They're back and sound as good as I remember. I excitedly told my girlfriend and she said "They're probably out of date anyway" 5 minitues later I showed her your posting. "Right again" I said.</p>

<p>I have the Sony V-6 (have had a pair for 10 years or more), 2 pairs of Etymotic (P-4 and P-6) for use when I am mowing the lawn or riding a motorcycle, and the Sennheiser HD-280 Pros.  I think the Sennheiser's may be just a tiny bit better than the Sony but the difference is very small.  I carry the Sony's to work and wear them when I go to bed (I put jazz on my CD player). </p>

<p>I couldn't use the Sony's for years because I could not find replacement earpads but I recently ordered two pairs from:</p>

<p>Hi.<br />
I got the 7506. Superb headphones!!<br />
just sold my sennheiser 280 pro, they just looked too nerdy/big, and the sony 7506 sounds a little better.. I compared the sony 7506 with my old, broken(!) pair of sony mdr v700dj, and the 700`s sound crappy and sharp/noisy compared to the more warm sounding 7506!!</p>

<p>I absolutely LOVE my MDR-V6 phones. They are by far the best-sounding phones with the best isolation, comfortable to wear...just perfect in every respect EXCEPT ONE. They suck for mixing audio. I don't mean they sound bad; they don't. They sound great. But they're NOT accurate. When I do a mix on the MDR-V6 phones and then take 'em off and listen to the same mix on tri-amped Genelec reference monitors, the mix sucks and I have to re-do everything. The Genelecs are flat-out the best sounding monitors in the world; they're balls-on accurate, and any time I mix on them, the mix sounds good anywhere else -- including on the MDR-V6 phones. </p>

<p>It's an enigma. I wish I could use the MDR-V6 phones for mixing, but I've learned the hard way not to do that. Nevertheless, they're still my favorite phones for every other purpose.</p>

<p>I first bought the MDR-V6 in 1991.  Hands down, they are the best cans I've ever used.  When, ten years later, I wanted to replace an earpad, which had split at the seam (their only minor drawback), I found that replacing the phones themselves was easier and more economical than getting just the pads.</p>

<p>However, finding new V6's was no easy task in 2001.  Sony had discontinued their production.  Sooo, thinking that the V600's were the alleged natural offspring of the V6, I bought a pair.  Man, was I disappointed.  The V600's, to put it mildly, suck, plain and simple.</p>

<p>Within two days, I did a more indepth search online and found that they were sold new at one or two places.  So I bought two pair and put one away in the closet for the inevitable 2010's.</p>

<p>Today's it's nice to see that they're back in production and easily found.  In fact, the earpads are now easily found and bought for under $10.  I know have the fourteen year-old pair, the four year-old pair, and the unused pair, all in perfect condition.  I may be set for life! :)</p>

<p>To paraphrase Kevin above, the MDR-V6's are indeed, for the money, the best headphones ever made.  Period.</p>

I have compared these phones to models priced 5x more & have yet to find a better sound.  If you want DEEP BASS capability without boomyness - then these are the phones to use.  Hey - don't take my word: Walk into ANY HI END HI-FI store that carries these phones & put them up AGAINST ANY PHONE REGARDLESS OF PRICE.  Fair enough?</p>

ONtop of this, the v6 may be the worst pair of headphones sony has produced. low out put, dull high frequency response. etc. etc. if you are a producer, buy a pair of ultrasones, if you want good clean listening for cheap<br />

<p>I mix CD's for a local high school, various choirs, ensembles, marching band, etc.  Getting these headphones was one of the best purchases I made, it allowed me to listen to the mix with a truly flat frequency response, uncolored by room accoustics or the cheap speakers plugged in to my PC.  They are a sonic marvel and would be a bargain at twice the price...crisp, clear and indestructable.  I have been pounding on mine now since 1999...and its 2006, I have taken them to more gigs than I can count...dropped 'em, stepped on 'em, worn 'em in the rain, stuffed 'em in a gear bag, exposed them to sun, sleet, freezing rain, they just keep on going.  </p>

<p>The rest of my "studio" consists of Marshall V67g condensor microphones, a Sony single point stereo condensor mic, Audio-Technica ATR-30 dynamics, Behringer Eurorack mixer, Gateway laptop with Creative Labs Audigy 2 ZX card and record a 44.1khz sampling rate in 24 bit resolution.  For the super-portable stuff I use a Sharp MD-MT90 Minidisk recorder.  I used to use Syntrillium Cool Edit Pro but now I use Magix Audio Cleaning lab 10, it used to be a joke but now it rather rocks.</p>

<p>I bought my MDR-V6s about 20 years ago and have really like them. Had the earpad problem but just found the answer with this column (thank's to those with parts info)! At my age, I'm having a hard time hearing dialogue on DVDs. I think its partly the surround mix, partly the reproduction, and partly old age hearing but yesterday my player was on the fritz and I poped a DVD into my computer and used the MDR-V6s. No problemo! I went through the entire movie without subtitles and didn't miss a word. Maybe my hearing isn't as bad as I thought:) Anyway, the MDR-V6s have always been great headphones and I've used them with many CD players because of the great reproduction, especially into the low end.<br />

<p>That's not dynamic range, but frequency response range.  And they're exactly the same drivers.  The difference you're seeing is just from a separate set of test results.  The impendence value is like one number off.  Same phones.  There have been pairs that have come out of the factory with one side saying v6 and the other 7506.  Difference is the gold plug, sticker colors, and the part listing on the box of the 7506, which the V6's doesn't have.</p>

<p>The V6 is the best headphone ever?  You must have tried very few headphones.  I own Etymotic ER4S, Extreme Isolation Headphones, HN-7506 isolator headphones (uses the Sony drivers), a bunch of Koss, and have used Grado 60s, Sennheiser HD580s, Denon 950, Pioneer 1000's, Ixos MOS10000's, Koss 950 electrostatics, and Sony V600's, in addition to the Sony 7506/V6 cans.</p>

<p>The 7506 has slightly too much mid/upper bass and fatiguing, peaky, bright treble to people who listen to non-acoustic music and still have good hearing.  Besides that it's quite good, and the mids have an open quality a lot of people like a lot.  The HN-7506 solves the treble problem for $300 and give you 30dB of isolation.</p>

<p>V7's used a 40mm driver the same as the V6. Indeed I replaced the drivers in my V7's with V6 drivers when one of the originals started to buzz.</p>

<p>Yes, the old V6 and modern V7506 are effectively the same, but I never really knew how the V7 was different.</p>

<p>I've owned or tried many headphones in the past 20 years, and currently own my second pair of MDR-V6's.  They're great.  Got the present pair at a local flea market for $5 in new condition.  I lived/worked in Hong Kong in the late '80's and early '90's, and it's fair to say that if you are interested in gadgets of any type (including headphones), then Hong Kong is hog heaven.  While there, I went through perhaps 10-15 different models of Sony headphones, including my first MDR-V6's.  Also had V600, V7's V9's, V900's, and probably some models not sold outside of Asia.</p>

<p>All told, most Sony headphones are fairly good, with the MDR-V6's as one of their standouts.  One Christmas I went shopping for a first class pair of headphones, and went to my favorite shop.  I started with the Sony's I was familiar with and all were OK to good, and then the dealer brought out Sennheizer 580's.  Fine headphone, and probably better than the average Sony.  The dealer was teasing me with ever better headphones, apparently trying to see how much I would fork over for headphones.  From the Sennheizer's top of the line, I listened to the top of the line from Sony at that time (can't remember model number).  They were fantastic and I was almost ready to buy.  They dealer asked if I wanted to hear the best he had in the shop.  Sure!  Out came the Beyer Dynamic DT-990 Professional headphones.  Game over.  They are absoluely remarkable.</p>

<p>Of my current headphones, I would still list them first, with the Sony MDR-CD580 next, and the MRD-V6 third.  I have the MDR-V600's which work well for recording (comfortable and well sealed), and also obtained the MDR-V500's from a Sony outlet store.  They're about the same price as the MDR-V6's at Fry's, but nowhere near the sound.  Good thing I didn't pay much for them.</p>

<p>And one last comment.  For about 2 years I owned (got from an estate sale) a pair of medium priced Stax headphones.  Medium price is a relative term here.  Stax are nothing short of incredible, that is, if you can stand being "leashed" to the driver box.  I finally got tired of that, and sold them on eBay.  If you don't mind the "teather", Stax pretty much own that end of the sprectrum, if you care to afford them.  $1500 to %5000 is a bit pricey for headphones IMHO.</p>

I've listened to critical sound on "industry standard" speakers and headphones.  After "roughing in" the sound on those - I plug in my MDR-V6s to make sure the sound is perfect.  I even use them on my tiny little metal iPod.  These headphones have served me very well and I have a spare pair just in case my first set ever fails.  Sound is subjective, but out of the dozen or so headphones that I own and the countless I've used in my profession, to my ear these are as close to perfect as possible.</p>

<p>I bought my MDR-V6's in the late 80's.  I'm listening to them at this very moment over 20 years later (Joe Satriani - "Back to Shalla-Bal").  My co-workers with earbuds laugh at me.  I just smile back while I rock my ass off with sound they can only dream of.  The earpads have split at the seams, but I'm ordering new ones thanks to the info in these comments.  Thanks everyone!!!</p>

<p>Is there something wrong with my ears or my 'phones? (seriously). I was looking for a decent pair of headphones to relax with my new Samsung MP3 player because I hate ear buds, and I remembered I had the MDR-V6s in the drawer -- I've had them so long (and used them so rarely) that I had completely forgotten about them. But when I tried them out the sound lacked the depth and richness (sorry, don't know the technical terms) I'd been getting even with the earbuds that came with my Samsung. Now I *know* for a fact that I don't have a more discerning ear than all the people who posted above. Is it time for a new set of V6s or a checkup with my doctor? Or is the V6 simply not well matched to my MP3 player in some way?</p>

<p>Carl,<br />
The V-6 are a flat response headphon, which basically means you are only going to hear what was put into the audio. This makes them good for mixing<br />
but not the greatest for listening to MP3s which are missing frequencies.<br />
That and the fact that all mp3s are not created equal with many having questionable origins since anyone who rips them who is not concerned<br />
with quality will not do the best job. There are probably better headphones<br />
for that purpose.</p>

<p>Absolutely love these cans!!! I bought mine from etronics through Amazon for only $65. Unfortunately, just last week I spilled coffee on my PC at work, which shorted it out. My headphones were plugged into the PC at the time and got damaged (they still "work", but the volume is really low, the  mid range is now flat, and the brightness and detail are distorted - honky sounding...). Well, I ordered another pair of V6's from Amazon for the same price and I should have them next week.</p>

<p>Lesson learned: Coffee and computers (and headphones) don't mix.</p>

<p>In reply to Michael Poteat's post, thanks for the link (see below) to buy Sony MDR-V600 earpads.</p>

<p>How do I properly disassemble the earpieces to replace the old earpads?  Before I order the earpads, I want to ensure that I can successfully perform the mechanics of this process in order to have a functional headset in the end.  I see that each earpiece has a single small screw on its top side (facing the inside of the headband).  By unscrewing it, can the round, outer, plastic cover be [easily] removed thereby exposing the inner ring of the earpad?</p>

<p>I can hardly believe what I am reading here.</p>

<p>I own a pair of the V6 phones and they are bar none the worst sounding headphones ever for music. They are great for human voices, being mid range crazy and tinny. Everything sounds like AM radio.</p>

<p>Even the V600s are much much nicer, but my favorites are Senneheiser 580s.</p>

<p>I am telling u fact not an opinion best head phones for the mid range price and yes $300.48 s&h isincludedin that price. is midrange price when you are talking about headphones. it takes the The Grado Series GS 1000's at $995.00 not including s&h to compare in sound, probably the best sounding headphones around though, or the Audio Technica ATHW5000 at around $1,600. Now for you Die hard Sony fans if you want true sony sound that is one of the best sounding headphones period and I'm not even a sony fan but will agree there great is the Sony MDR-SA5000 at $359. Now those comfy head phones theone guy was talking about and there top of the line is Beyerdynamic DT 880 can get at $220.  Now for teh ear bud lovers and still want kick ass sound and to be comfortable and ingenious design u want the Westone UM2's at around $299. A better earbud is the Shure E500 PTH at around $366.Another ear bud is the Etymotic ER4 better price but not comparable to the ShureE500's but is priced at about $166 u can find. If you want to pay under 180 bucks u want the Technics RP-DJ1200 or RP-DJ1200a which just look diff are same otherwise. Dj's rave about them , and I think they have some of the best bass any headhone can offer period and def for the price. Hope this helps someone. Peace!!! </p>

<p>I can't comment on the V6s but I am still using a pair of V3s I've had since the mid 80s. Okay, the pads are shot but the sound is still pretty clean. The bass sounds good and so do the mids and top. <br />
I am looking for a new pair of cans. Have tried Grado SR80s and Sennheiser HD280s. Preferred the open sound of the Grados but am thinking about going for the SR225s. But then again how do the V6s compare to the SR225s?</p>

<p>I also had a number of V6's through the 90's. When it came time to replace them I tried the V600 but they are definitely not the same, and do not sound as good. Then I found the Sony 7506 - awesome, it's exactly the same as the V6 was, in fact they even look exactly the same as I remember the V6 looking.  I also tried the 7509 but they were way too bass heavy - very unnatural sounding.  I have tried numerous other high end phones, including canal, but always come back to the 7506.  The only negative is that they make me hot during extended listening.  I will soon be trying the Sony F1 which should solve that problem.  </p>

<p>I have to say...I was really excited to read all the rave reviews of these headphones...but after a side-by-side comparison to my cheaper Koss Portapro's, I have to say the Koss phones achieved considerable superior reproduction of sound...the clarity, detail and dimension (of highs and lows) that I hear through the Portapro's is not matched by the MDR's.  In comparison the MDR's sound rather muddy...and I've tested them both on various devices...can anyone recommend me a better sounding pair of reasonably priced closed ear phones for subway commuting?</p>

<p>I bought my first MDR V6 Studio Monitor headphones back in 1988 and have used them pretty much daily ever since. My only knock on these bullet proof headphones is after about 10 years the leather like ear pads will break down around the edges. The surprising thing is they sell Sony brand replacements for $12 all over the net and I've yet to replace mine after 21 years. One of the greatest features of these headphones is the multitude of ways you can wear them: on one ear, no ears while talking, flipped open and held against your ear, over hats on both ears...  Sony has made many attempts over the years to create a better design then the V6 style with no luck. My single pair has been used with Reel to Reel, Audio Cassettes, Mixing boards, Betamax, DAT, Amiga's Video Toaster, Walkman, MiniDisc, NeXt, The Diamond Rio Mp3-not the band, iPods, Ps3, iPhones-the Rev. A needed an adaptor and many iMacs.<br />
Now my Daughter who wasn't even born when I purchased my pair has asked for her own V6's for her Macbook Pro for Christmas to bring back to Collage.<br />
I just paid $109 at the Sony Style store in Silicon Valley for a product that might just out live us all, I hope I didn't pay to much :) </p>

<p>i've been spinning with v6's since 1985 and a friend just LOST them while moving my gear between locations, and i immediately went to replace them, but when i discovered Ortofon was now making phones i ordered up some 02's. i figured i couldn't go wrong with my fave cart maker and a set of phones by the same maker - match made in heaven right? sound wise maybe, but i wouldn't know because i packed them right back up after trying them on. heavy, thick band pad is funky and the angles make them wanna slip off your head when dj'ing.. and they're *made* for dj'ing..</p>

<p>now to scramble to find some v6's *somewhere* before friday or i'll have to get some cheapos for the event. the place i bought the Orts from said i had 30 days to return them but they're the most ill-fitting phones i've ever tried and i'll be pulling my hair out by night's end from fussing with them all night, and my ears will be sore from being pulled on. the v6's just sit on your head and stay there, no ear-twisting cups, not too heavy, adequate sound and volume for me as i keep the phones very low when i mix, just enough to pick up the beat. </p>

<p>Sony MDR V6 are good for something from the 1980's however these days you can buy so much better.</p>

<p>Audio Technica ATH AD 700 Open Air<br />
Are the best headphones sound quality wise you can for under $250-$300.<br />
Anyone saying otherwise is just fooling themselves.<br />
The soundstage,clarity,separation of instruments and vocals with nothing being drowned out is astonishing. </p>

<p>However since they are Open Air their for home listening only.<br />
You can get them for about $90 or a little more on webstores. The MSRP is $250 but authentic dealers do sell them at this price.</p>

<p>And with some albums after listening to them on Audio Technica's the Sony sound like absolute garbage.</p>

<div class="comments-text">
<p>My dad had some Sony headphones he bought in the early 90's. I'm blind, so I never knew the model number. It was a nice big set of headphones, but one thing I remember is that the headband had an elastic ribbon on the sides, then on the top, attached to the elastic ribbon, a plastic thingy with a slot in the middle. Don't know if I'm describing this right, but it's the only way I know to describe it. Do these headphones have that elastic/plastic thing? Just wondering if I've found those old headphones!</p>
