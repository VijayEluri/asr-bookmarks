<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
I guess I'll have to shut you down for good this time,<br>
Already tried a </font><font face="Courier New">SIGQUIT</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
so now it's KILL DASH 9.<br>
You gotta learn when it's time for your thread to yield;<br>
It shoulda slept; instead you stepped and now your fate is sealed.<br>
I'll take your process off the run queue without even asking<br>
'Cause my flow is like reentrant and preemptive multitasking.<br>
Your sad rhymes are spinnin' like you're in a deadlock,<br>
You're like a synchronous sock that don't know when to block;<br>
So I pull out my keyboard and I pull out my glock,<br>
And I dismount your girl and I</font><font face="Courier New"> mount /proc</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
And I've got your fuckin </font><font face="Courier New">pid</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
and the bottom line<br>
Is that you best not front or else it's KILL DASH NINE.<br>
<br>
KILL DASH NINE,<br>
No more CPU time.<br>
I run KILL DASH NINE,<br>
And your process is mine.<br>
I run KILL DASH NINE,<br>
'Cause it's MY time to shine<br>
So don't step outta line or else it's<br>
KILL DASH NINE!<br>
<br>
See it ain't about the Benjamins or Pentiums or Athlons,<br>
But you rappin' 50 meters while I'm spittin' in decathlons.<br>
Your shit's old and busted, mine's the new hotness;<br>
You're like CLR and I'm like CLRS.<br>
You're running </font><font face="Courier New">csh</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
and my shell is </font><font face="Courier New">bash</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">,<br>
You're the tertiary storage; I'm the L1 cache.<br>
I'm a web crawling spider; you an Internet mosquito;<br>
You thought the 7-layer model referred to a burrito.<br>
You're a dialup connection; I'm a gigabit LAN.<br>
I last a mythical man-month; you a one-minute man.<br>
It's like I'm running Thunderbird and you're still stuck with Pine,<br>
Which is why I think it's time for me to KILL DASH NINE.<br>
<br>
Yeah it's KILL DASH NINE<br>
No more CPU time.<br>
'Cause it's KILL DASH NINE,<br>
And your process is mine.<br>
I said KILL DASH NINE<br>
'Cause it's my time to shine,<br>
So don't step outta line or else it's<br>
KILL DASH NINE!<br>
<br>
My posse throws down like leaky bucket regulators;<br>
I was coding shit in MIPS while you were playing Space Invaders.<br>
With my finger on the trigger I run </font><font face="Courier New">./configure</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
Yo, this package is big, but MY package is bigger.<br>
I roll my weed with Zig Zag while I zag-zig splay,<br>
And I do a bounds check before I write to an array.<br>
I'm a loc'd out baller writing KLOCS a day,<br>
'Cause it's publish or perish, fool, what can I say?<br>
I'm 26 now, will I live to see 28?<br>
Some days I wonder if I'll survive to graduate.<br>
But hey, that's just fine, I won't ever resign,<br>
And if fools try to step then it's KILL DASH NINE!<br>
<br>
Yeah it's KILL DASH NINE,<br>
From my command line<br>
It's KILL DASH NINE<br>
Sending chills down your spine,<br>
I said KILL DASH NINE,<br>
'Cause it's my time to shine,<br>
So don't step outta line or else it's<br>
KILL DASH NINE!<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Courier New">fs sa rlidwka</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
I'll </font><font face="Courier New">chown</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
your home and take your access away<br>
Comin' straight outta Stanford, ain't nobody tougher,<br>
Control-X, Control-C, I'll discard your fuckin' buffer.<br>
You're outside your scope, son, close them curly brackets,<br>
'Cause I drop punk-ass bitches like a modem drops packets.<br>
Dump your motherfucking core, and trace your stack<br>
'Cause where your ass is going, there won't be no callback.<br>
See my style is divine and my code is sublime,<br>
My career's in a climb and yours is in a decline.<br>
I'll write a pound-define and assign you as mine,<br>
So refine those sad rhymes or remove your plus signs,<br>
<br>
Or it's KILL DASH NINE,<br>
No more CPU time,<br>
'Cause it's KILL DASH NINE,<br>
And your process is mine,<br>
I said KILL DASH NINE<br>
'Cause it's my time to shine,<br>
Bitch you stepped outta line and now it's <br>
KILL DASH NINE!<br>
