<p>It's time again for the annual <a href="http://woodblock.com/gift/index.php5en">Gift Print</a>. Each year as we approach the gift season, I select one of the designs from my many series, get the blocks out of the storeroom, print up a batch specifically for this purpose, and put it into my Mokuhankan catalogue. The gift print for this year is an interesting image of a 'floating carp' adapted from a design by Katsushika Hokusai.</p>

	<p>In a radical departure from the previous two decades of making reproductions of traditional Japanese prints, this project featured designs of my own creation. <a href="http://woodblock.com/solitudes/index.html">My Solitudes</a> was a three-year project (summer '07 ~ spring '10), which consisted of a set of 12 woodblock prints, each paired with 
a chapter of a book, together illustrating and describing three of my 'private' nature retreats through the course of a year.</p>
	<p>Now that the series is complete, the 12 prints/books are available either as a complete set all at once, or as a monthly 'subscription' over the course of a year.</p>

	<p>After many years of thinking about it, I have finally opened a woodblock print publishing venture - <a href="http://mokuhankan.com">Mokuhankan</a>. My own personal subscription-based printmaking will continue, but now, alongside that, I will publish prints produced by other craftsmen working under my direction. I hope you find some of the prints to your liking!</p>

	<p>Young Japanese printer Urushibara went to England in 1910 as part of a group of craftsmen demonstrating woodblock printmaking techniques for the Anglo-Japanese Exhibition held that year in London.</p>
	<p>Thirty years would pass before he returned to Japan. During those years he taught woodblock printmaking, worked in collaboration with many European artists to make prints, and created a lot of original work as well. A fortuitous meeting between Dave Bull (owner of woodblock.com) and Ichiro Urushibara (the artst's son) has led to the creation of <a href="http://woodblock.com/urushibara/index.html">this website</a>, which utilizes many of the archive materials - prints, correspondence, photos, etc. - that were formerly 'lost' in England at the onset of WWII, when Mokuchu was forced to return to Japan.</p>
