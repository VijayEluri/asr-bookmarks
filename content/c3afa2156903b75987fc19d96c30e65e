            <p><i>New Yorker</i> staff writer and author of the recently published 
              <i><a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/partner?partner_id=25548&cgi=search/search/&searchtype=kw&searchfor=adam%20gopnik%20paris%20moon" target="_blank">Paris 
              To The Moon</a></i>, Adam Gopnik lived in Paris with his family 
              from 1995 to 2000 and wrote the magazine's "Paris Journals," prompting 
              the French newspaper <i>Le Monde</i> to regard him as a "witty and 
              Voltairean commentator on French life." His work has won awards 
              from the National Magazine Award for Essay and Criticism to the 
              George Polk Award for Magazine Reporting. While some of the essays 
              in <i><a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/partner?partner_id=25548&cgi=search/search/&searchtype=kw&searchfor=adam%20gopnik%20paris%20moon" target="_blank">Paris 
              To The Moon</a></i> come from his <i>New Yorker</i> filings, there 
              is also much new material from Gopnik's very engaging and original 
              take on being an American in Paris and more. Adam Gopnik has returned 
              to New York, where he now resides with his wife, Martha Parker, 
              and their children, Luke and Ollivia.</p>
            <p><b>Robert Birnbaum:</b> What was the end-of-the-millennium in Paris 
              like?</p>
            <p><b>Adam Gopnik:</b> It was a very successful thing. It just was 
              beautiful and successful, and I think everyone admired it...with 
              what <i>panache</i> it was celebrated. So it was a big deal, but 
              it wasn't a heavyweight deal.</p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> It wasn't a spectacle?</p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> Yeah, it was a spectacle. We had this amazing fireworks 
              show at the Eiffel Tower. I was comparing it to the millennial celebration 
              in London, particularly. And that was very hyped, and then all of 
              the elements of it&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;the Ferris wheel they had built 
              didn't work&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;and the Millennium Dome, though a very 
              beautiful building, was a failure. So in the long-range competition 
              between Paris and London, we won the millennium.</p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> Is it the case that you don't much care for the British?</p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> No, no, not at all. We thought of moving to London, 
              in fact, after Paris. No, we love it. I guess I have inherited some 
              of the French prejudice against them. I am a patriotic Parisian. 
              If you are a patriotic Parisian, you root against London, as when 
              you are a patriotic Bostonian, you root against New York a little 
              bit.</p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> Towards the end of the book, your wife, Martha, makes 
              the distinction between a beautiful existence and a full life.</p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> In Paris we had, not just we had, but one has a genuinely 
              beautiful existence. That is to say, all of the little details of 
              life&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;or nearly all&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;are pleasing. 
              Some that aren't...one gets exasperated with the bureaucracy...So 
              every detail of one's daily life&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;from the place 
              you go to get breakfast to how you shop for Brussel Spouts, is pleasing 
              to the eye, pleasing to the soul, in some sense. But we didn't have 
              a full life in the sense that we weren't fully connected. It wasn't 
              home. It wasn't the place were we had&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;where on 
              a banal level&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;where the people we were closest 
              to lived. But on a deeper level it wasn't where our life took place. 
              In my years in Paris&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;if you are a writer in English&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;your 
              primary nationality is the English language, and Paris is not the 
              capitol of that country.</p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> You wrote that you breathe in your first language and 
              you swim in your second.</p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> I think we felt that. So all of that deep sense of connection, 
              of being plugged into things, was something that we missed in Paris, 
              finally. In that sense our life wasn't as full, though our existence 
              was much more beautiful than any that was available to us in New 
              York. Or any that we found in New York.</p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> If you tie this to a linguistic condition, then would 
              you have had a fuller life in London?</p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> No, I don't think so. I think it goes deeper than that. 
              One of the lessons that I think we learned&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;one 
              of the morals of the book, in a sense&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;is that home 
              is home. It's not that there is no place like it. Or rather the 
              way to say it is, "There is no place like it." Which is not to say 
              that there is no place better. There are lots of places better, 
              but there is no place like it. I was telling someone this morning 
              that a eureka moment for me was when I was taking a bath with our 
              son Luke and I started singing to him that Sam and Dave song, &quot;Land 
              of a Thousand Dances.&quot; You know, "Na&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;na na 
              na&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;, na ..." and he said, "Daddy, what is that?" 
              I said, "Oh, it's 'Land of A Thousand Dances'" "What is 'Land of 
              A Thousand Dances?'" "It's a song." "Why its called, 'Land of a 
              Thousand Dances?'"...In that little five syllable chant was encoded 
              a hundred associations, facts about life. Everything about Stax 
              records to going on vacations. And that full life was not one that 
              one could have in Paris. He would have it in Paris, growing up in 
              Paris.</p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> Where is home for your [six year old] son?</p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> New York. Somewhat to my shock and even a little bit 
              to my sadness. He loves being in New York and doesn't seem to miss 
              Paris at all. Even though Paris was the only place he'd ever lived. 
              To a degree that I didn't quite acknowledge he had a sense of himself 
              as an outsider. He once said to us&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;at one point 
              he had some sort of altercation with a kid. I said I would go talk 
              to him. And he said, "Oh don't bother, Daddy, I know the way these 
              French kids think."</p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> You grew up in Philadelphia, lived in Montreal, but 
              you still talk about New York City as your home?</p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> Yeah, we moved there 20 years ago. So it feels like 
              home in that way.</p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> What has it been like since you have been back?</p>
            <p><a href="../idgraphics/gopnik2.jpg"><img src="../idgraphics/gopnik2thumb.jpg" style="float:right;border:none;padding:15px;" alt="gopnik" /></a><b>AG:</b> 
              Difficult. Not unhappy. It's wonderful being back. And I'm trying 
              to write about New York now. When you have young children, the children 
              are the world. So things stay very much the same. One of the reasons 
              we had a less full life was because of the children, because having 
              small children will do that. When I was in Paris, I missed New York 
              a lot. Now that I'm in New York, I miss Paris a lot. That's a function 
              of forever yearning for the other place. Also, to some degree&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;I 
              don't want to make too much of this&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;I got radicalized 
              in Paris even though we had a very beautiful existence and that 
              was the essence of it. Things that I had always taken for granted 
              in America, forgive me this is sounds like the same fairly weary 
              stuff&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;violence, incarceration, capital punishment, 
              free-for-all medical care&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;you may deplore them, 
              curse them, but they seem to you to be part of the normal realm 
              of existence in America. Well, they are not. They're the exception. 
              They are the very strange exception to the general role of prosperous 
              societies at the end of the twentieth century, the beginning of 
              the third millennium. So I was genuinely shocked, the debasement 
              of American discourse&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;for lack of a better word&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;is 
              startling to me. </p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> Even though you had been watching CNN while living in 
              Paris?</p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> CNN Europe is a different thing. It's like a headline 
              service. I'm talking about the local news and American television. 
              For the first time the United States has a proletariat, permanently 
              depressed underclass. Maybe I was just inexperienced or something. 
              I don't know what it is. I genuinely find it shocking to turn on 
              American television and see how sordid...</p>
            <p> <b>RB:</b> Reality television?</p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> All those things, <i>Temptation Island</i>, XFL. I know 
              it's ever been thus... I remain very patriotic about the United 
              States, and being in France made me feel that way more strongly. 
              The other thing&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;I can say this as an observation 
              not as a polemic because I saw the other side&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;in 
              France, legitimacy lies on the Left. The things you have to say, 
              the taboos you have to avoid, the shibboleths you have to pay homage 
              to are all on the Left. Sometimes that can be quite wild. Because, 
              for instance, the French Communist Party is not fully de-Stalinized 
              and is still is treated with a good deal of respect. That can be 
              very exasperating at times. The French Left still doesn't want to 
              take responsibility for their long flirtation with Stalinism and 
              on and on. But it's shocking to come back here to America and see 
              that legitimacy lies exclusively on the Right. That is to say pretty 
              much all of the media is owned and controlled by large corporations, 
              and some corporations have extremely radical Right-wing agendas 
              which they are perfectly happy to push. Again, this is an extremely 
              banal observation, but it came as a shock to me.</p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> You did make much of the free health care in Paris when 
              your son came up with salmonella poisoning and nobody asked you 
              about insurance as a prerequisite for treating him. Even resident 
              aliens don't pay?</p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> Yeah, well we pay French taxes. The point is that nobody 
              asks that when you come in. The assumption is that everybody gets 
              free medical care on the point of delivery not that you check first 
              to see if you can pay for it.</p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> Amazing!</p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> It's true in Canada, in Great Britain.</p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> Your book is doing well, in its eighth printing. So 
              while you point out the debasement of American culture, a charming, 
              intelligent, funny book is doing well. Why is that?</p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> (laughs) I thought about that myself whenever I start 
              one of these screeds to my spouse. My wife says, &quot;If it's such 
              an awful society, then go and explain why they made your book a 
              bestseller.&quot; I can give you the self-serving hypothesis or 
              the accurate hypothesis.</p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> Let's go for both.</p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> The self-serving hypothesis is that there is still a 
              real audience of people who listen to NPR and read <i>The New Yorker</i> 
              and so on, an audience who responds to a certain type of writing. 
              That's the self-serving hypothesis. The accurate hypothesis is I 
              think that&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;not through any conscious plan, but 
              just as a happy serendipitous thing&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;that the idea 
              of elsewhere, precisely for the reasons we are talking about because 
              American culture seems so troubled in so many ways to people, the 
              idea of elsewhere is particularly appealing. I have a good friend 
              who said, when the book got on the bestseller list, &quot;It's <i>A 
              Year in Provence</i> meets <i>Tuesdays with Morrie</i>." It's an 
              exotic setting plus little life lessons. I was watching one of those 
              shout shows on television where everyone shouts at everybody else 
              about things. And they were all talking about what a brilliant job 
              George W. Bush had done, what a commanding presidential...and I'm 
              not even that highly politicized&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;I am perfectly 
              willing to believe that there is something to be said for a conservative 
              point of view&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;I can even imagine voting for John 
              Mc Cain. But you have a here a man who is so transparently...</p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> Brilliant would not be a word that I would associate 
              with President Bush.</p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> Yes, exactly, and so you feel, like Solzhenitsyn said, 
              "Live not by the lie." And you feel like there are so many organized 
              lies in American life that it's painful. But there are organized 
              lies in French life, too. It's just that I am newly sensitive to 
              the lies of American life. When I get in this black mood about coming 
              home I also remind myself of the other side of American life, that 
              we can pat ourselves on the back for, innovation, love of newness, 
              even the resurgence of American cooking. These things are real, 
              too. My friend Wilfred Sheed said, "This is a very big country. 
              Everything fits into it and it's always a mistake to get hysterical 
              about anything in America because it will just sort of fade off 
              into the prairie at some point and there will be another possibility 
              as well.&quot;</p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> What a happy thought.</p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> I remember the particular context in which he said it 
              to me. It was right after the Oklahoma bombing, and I wrote a somewhat 
              hysterical comment for <i>The New Yorker</i> about it. He was right 
              in a sense...obviously that was a horrific thing but that it's a 
              mistake to have a counter-hysteria about American life. It's a very 
              big country, lots goes on. That it hangs together at all as a country 
              is miraculous. It does change...well, my book. It sounds hypocritical 
              if I chide my own nativity which has bought my hardcover.</p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> Any sense of the Francophobia in this country?</p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> There is obviously both. There is a Francophiliac streak 
              or people wouldn't enjoy the book. And not so much Francophobic, 
              as Franco-ignorant.</p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> Well, there are those jokes about a country that offers 
              so many cheeses. And honors Jerry Lewis and Mickey Rourke. </p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> This is a bit of a myth. They honor Jerry Lewis because 
              they honor every American film star of that vintage. They honor 
              him considerably less than Robert Mitchum or Charles Laughton or 
              many other people. There is a strong Franco-phobic streak in Washington. 
              They see the French as being the people who are reflexively anti-American. 
              Which is not entirely false. There is an idealized notion of France 
              and Paris which is the alternative place. The urge to idealize France 
              is probably stronger than to deprecate it.</p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> You are not doing that. I was struck by your observation, 
              &quot;The unsentimental efficiency of French civilization of which 
              the French cafe is the highest embodiment is so brisk that it disarms 
              Nostalgia. History keeps wiping the table off and asking you, a 
              little impatiently, what you'll have now.&quot; </p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> Did I write that? I honestly didn't remember that. I 
              was trying to say that one of the things that is wonderful in Paris 
              is that even a place like the Cafe de Flore does not become a tourist 
              trap because it remains part of the contemporaniety of French life. 
              That's one of the great joys in France is that the division we make 
              between the visitable past and the living present, you don't make 
              that much. You can have a usable past in France. That's something 
              we don't have to the same degree here. There's an enormous available 
              past in France. You don't have to make a choice between nostalgia 
              and...the feeling of just how shallowly rooted the American past 
              is is something you learn when you live abroad. I have a friend 
              who when I left for Paris wrote to me and said that he could never 
              understand the appeal of this. "..it's a narrow centuries old happiness...it's 
              confining and stifling."</p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> 'This' meaning the need to go to Paris?</p>
            <p><a href="../idgraphics/gopnik1.jpg"><img src="../idgraphics/gopnik1thumb.gif" style="float:right;border:none;padding:15px;" alt="adam gopnik" /></a><b>AG:</b> 
              I understood that. I could see that. I hope one of the morals of 
              the book is to address that question. How do you love the past? 
              How do you love continuity without simply becoming a nostalgist? 
              For me, that was trying to do in that moment in the book at the 
              Millennium. When Luke and I were watching the Eiffel tower [fireworks]. 
              As long as human consciousness is recreated, then the world is made 
              new all the time. The Eiffel tower is as old as Luke is, in that 
              sense as he just stands there and watches it now. One of the things 
              I'm struggling with in the book, exploring, not resolving in any 
              way, is how do you passionately love the past and still be of your 
              time?</p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> When you use the word 'shallow' about America's sense 
              of history, I think that may be generous. It would seem to be regularly 
              trivialized... </p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> I was stunned by that when <i>Saving Private Ryan</i> 
              opened in France. The Americans did all the fighting. Not only were 
              there no French people involved in the war, but no Canadians, no 
              Brits. One of the things about Omaha Beach is that it was a horrible 
              fuck up. It was the one fuck up on D-Day. The Canadians took their 
              beaches. In a relatively untroubled way the British took theirs. 
              The Americans just fucked up. Yet, we represent that fuck up as 
              the only event and as in itself heroic.</p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> You coined the law of inverse natural appeal?</p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> Yes, at the Cafe de Flore. It's always true. If you 
              have ever been at Elaine's in New York. Still is where celebrities 
              go, writers and so on. It's got the worst food, the ugliest decor 
              and the most unhospitable people. New York is filled with beautiful 
              restaurants with wonderful food, and charming servers, right? But 
              if you went there what would be the accomplishment, right? So you 
              go to a place with terrible food and horrible decor and then it 
              can only be your presence that's gracing that is lending it significance.</p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> You talk a lot about the French habit of abstraction. 
              You find this to be key to their culture...</p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> Absolutely, I think it is the biggest... I wrote a lecture 
              and I said that the three biggest differences between France and 
              America were: attitudes towards youth and age, attitudes as your 
              role as producer and consumer, and finally the weight you give empirical 
              evidence in everyday argument and conversation. And I do think that's 
              the biggest one. It's thrilling and exhilarating in lots of ways. 
              One of the good things about it is that everyone is always searching 
              for the real significance, the philosophical significance of an 
              event. It means you have a much more reflective turn of mind. It's 
              a society that values philosophers over lawyers. I like that about 
              it very much. It also means that people can live in absolute isolation 
              from reality. It's very hard to produce counter-evidence for an 
              argument in France. You just make up another argument. I give the 
              example in the book of fact-checking. No one I ever spoke to in 
              Paris could understand what the point was of having a fact checker 
              call to check the facts. The lovely thing about it is the tendency 
              to always look for a way around it all. </p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> Where does this characteristic come from?</p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> Education. People will say that it's the Cartesian tradition. 
              The difference between Descartes and Locke in the 17th century...the 
              difference between rationalism and empiricism. We rented <i>Apollo 
              13</i> when we were in France. I thought of the time when Ed Harris 
              says, "Gentlemen, let's work the problem. Let's not make things 
              worse by guessing." It wouldn't happen in France. </p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> Tell me about the way the book was put together.</p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> Sixty percent was published in <i>The New Yorker</i> 
              and almost all those pieces are intact...tiny changes. They only 
              represent about half of what I wrote about France while I was in 
              France. I made a rule of writing two third-person pieces for every 
              first piece that I wrote. Very few of the third-person pieces were 
              right for this book. I was conscious as I began writing them that 
              some would be for the book and some would not.</p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> Why did you make that rule?</p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> This is sort of a preoccupation of mine. Readers&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;I 
              seem to have been proven entirely wrong by the success of this book&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;would 
              welcome you, allow you to write in the first person, to write your 
              own preoccupations if they were sure that you were doing it with 
              a reason. It wasn't something you reflexively did every time out. 
              There are some writers who are simply incapable of taking any tone 
              but their own. I thought if you could demonstrate that you were 
              perfectly well in control of a much more distanced and impersonal 
              view of things than when you begin a piece, "I've been trying to 
              get some exercise..." or however that piece begins about the gym 
              then the reader would know, "Oh, he must have something to tell 
              me..." You use the first person when there's a story. You begin 
              in mental state A and end in mental state B. A third-person piece 
              isn't like that. Somebody else begins in mental or physical state 
              A and ends mental or physical state B. That was my theory, that 
              readers wouldn't tolerate first-person pieces. I turned out to be 
              completely wrong about that. Also, of all forms of literature, I 
              like best the personal essay. I like the personal comic essay. Thurber, 
              Trillin, Montaigne. The line between invention and schtick is more 
              delicate in that form than any other. The line between when you 
              are actually speaking from the heart and making people laugh and 
              touching them and when you are doing schtick&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;essentially 
              doing stand-up of a literary kind. It falls over very quickly into 
              that so you have to have to be really careful.</p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> I find that Trillin does cross that line. But I thought 
              <i>Killings</i> was great... </p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> He's one of the writers that's influenced me the most. 
              I read <i>US Journal</i> when I was ten or so. I felt that because 
              he could do the straight reporting that you were always ready, when 
              he wanted to talk to you in the first person, to hear what he had 
              to say. He was kind of a model in that way. I'm trying to write 
              a new thing, <i>New York Journal</i> and I was determined to do 
              the whole thing for the next five years as a series of impersonal 
              vignettes of New York life. I'm going to break that rule [laughs] 
              next week. I think I have a funny story to tell, so I'm going to 
              go ahead and tell it. Rules for writing are unreal and arbitrary 
              in that way. </p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> That doesn't seem to be a rule for writing but more 
              a guideline or focusing principle...</p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> I did the Paris thing, with a certain tone. But I have 
              to give it up. New York demands something else. You can't over-rationalize 
              writing. It's like saying, &quot;I'm a short man with a bald spot 
              and now I'm coming back and they've seen the short man with the 
              bald spot so now I'll become a tall thin elegant man with a full 
              heads of hair.&quot; That's not one of the options that is open 
              to you...</p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> I had a talk with essayist Ted Hoagland; he offered 
              the opinion that in the next few decades that the personal essay 
              would flourish, both for readers and writers.</p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> I think it's already been true to some degree. I've 
              been reading the Diaries of Kenneth Tynan. He said that he the thought 
              that the strong forms of our time, the forms that would be remembered 
              were all personal essay, memoir, diary. I can't think of two writers 
              more unlike than myself and Dave Eggers. But Eggers' book is not 
              really a novel. Part of its strength is you "believe"&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;with 
              however many quotation marks around it&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;you believe 
              that it is a true story. There is a play between truth and artifice 
              in it. That is what we respond to. It's a treacherous form because 
              the line between entertainment and egomania is particularly fine 
              and difficult. Essayists generally&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;and certainly 
              me particularly&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;tend to be more like performers 
              than novelists. Novelists are like architects or builders. They 
              are willing to sit in a room for five or six years and build something 
              and they at some level don't give a damn what the public thinks. 
              They want to make a cathedral for themselves to live in and then 
              they open the doors. If you come in to worship that's fine. And 
              if you don't that's fine, too. Essayists aren't like that. At least 
              this one isn't. You have to have a bit of the ham in you. You like 
              to do the thing and feel that the people are reacting.</p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> It's more social? More engaged.</p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> More performative. </p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> Which means you are conscious of an audience.</p>
            <p> <b>AG:</b> That's right. Obviously essays have always had a deep 
              connection to journalism. Dr. Johnson was a miscellaneous journalist. 
              Hazlitt was. The essay is one of those forms...it has to be alloyed 
              by something else. When you want to write a literary essay, you 
              find a book to review. </p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> How long have you been at <i>The New Yorker</i>?</p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> 15 years.</p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> That's through three editorial regimes?</p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> Four, I was there at the end of Shawn's. I published 
              for Shawn's magazine from the outside.</p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> Why this ongoing publication of books about life at 
              <i>The New Yorker</i>, unlike any other literary entity? What's 
              so compelling about it?</p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> There is a good reason and a bad reason. I wrote an 
              introduction to a new edition of Thurber's book <i>My Years With 
              Ross</i>, one of the first books about <i>The New Yorker</i> back 
              in 1960. The bad reason is that it seems like either a very churchy 
              club or a very clubby church. That's the unattractive part. The 
              good reason, I like to think, is because the magazine for good or 
              ill has been a place that has been hospitable to a particular kind 
              of American writing, a particular kind of American voice. And I 
              try in that introduction to itemize, to catalogue some of things 
              I think in particular about that kind of American voice. There is 
              a particular American tradition that probably starts with Twain's 
              <i>Life on The Mississippi</i>, a particular American tone. It doesn't 
              belong to <i>The New Yorker</i>, it doesn't belong to any magazine 
              as a brand. It exists outside <i>The New Yorker</i>. Some of the 
              best <i>New Yorker</i> writers, some of the great masters of a particular, 
              casual and yet contemplative vernacular have not written for <i>The 
              New Yorker</i>. My hero, Randall Jarrell, for instance. I could 
              name many other writers. It's not a brand that <i>The New Yorker</i> 
              owns, but it is a voice that <i>The New Yorker</i> has helped keep 
              in existence. There is a good reason to be fascinated because it 
              represents a particular line or tradition in American writing, and 
              if it [<i>The New Yorker</i>] disappeared tomorrow, it would be 
              very hard to re-assemble all of it in one place. </p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> Why have and are the critiques of <i>The New Yorker</i> 
              so nasty?</p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> I been away for a while, so I haven't dealt with much 
              of that. The Tina Brown years were a real change in the magazine. 
              The DNA of a magazine generally, tends to be fairly strong; a magazine 
              is what it is not so much because of the people who run it but because 
              of the readers who read it. It has to be one thing or another. What's 
              remarkable about <i>The New Yorker</i> is not how different it is 
              but how much alike it is and the similarities come from the attentions 
              of the readers. I really do believe that.</p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> The magazine does seem revitalized.</p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> The last ten years have seen an enormous revitalization. 
              To return to my own petty little garden, I think that the fact that 
              people read these pieces and then wanted to have them in a book 
              is a good sign for the magazine. For a while the rule was that a 
              collection of <i>New Yorker</i> pieces wouldn't work anymore as 
              a book. </p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> Are your ambitions small ambitions? Do you have a big 
              book in mind? A novel?</p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> I'm madly ambitious, but I don't mind working on a small 
              canvas. At some point as a writer you learn it's not what you want 
              to do, it's what you are capable of doing, what you do well. I think 
              the four-to-five-thousand-word essay is the thing that I'm...</p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> What about when you dream?</p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> Dream of doing other things? I have finished a long 
              adventure story for children, or not for children. A long adventure 
              story set in Paris called <i>The King in The Window</i>. That will 
              be very different than this. I wish I could say that I was a humble 
              and modest writer. In fact, I am a very ambitious writer, but I 
              do believe ambition at this moment finds reasonable release in, 
              if not fragmentary if not constrained work which slowly over time 
              becomes a coral reef of sensibility. One of the writers that I admire 
              the most of my generation is <a href="http://www.identitytheory.com/people/birnbaum12.html">Nicholson 
              Baker</a>, among fiction writers. Baker works out of tiny observed 
              details, out of a very small canvas. But unambitious is the last 
              thing that he is.</p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> What in addition to writing do you do?</p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> I teach. I lecture. There was a bad moment in my life 
              just before we left for Paris when I was trying and failing miserably 
              to be a pundit of a kind. I wrote about the crisis of the press 
              and all those kinds of terrible thing. And I appeared on a couple 
              of those panels. That's one of the things that impelled me to go 
              to Paris. That's living death for a writer when you become a person 
              on panels. I like to give lectures and I love the hammy side of 
              it, too, but I never want be somebody who gives opinions on general 
              subjects.</p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> What are some of the books you read?</p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> I hesitate because I'd leave something out...though 
              who would care? (laughs). Trollope. Trollope's political novels 
              seem to me to be the most wonderful in the language. Updike is, 
              too, evidently, and embarrassingly a model for what I do. I never 
              find a dead line in his work. There is not a piece of it that is 
              not alive on the page. I read and reread Bill James, the baseball 
              analyst. A wonderful writer, one of one of the really wonderful 
              American forensic writers. I have a liking for the form I do. I 
              like Henry James' letters more than I like his novels. A terrible 
              admission to make but to be truthful I do. I think they are amazing. 
              And I like James' two volumes of autobiography. Those are my two 
              favorite American books. I like Virginia Woolf's essays which strike 
              me as the high point of literary writing of that kind. So it's not 
              simply an expression of my limitations abut also an expression of 
              my prejudices.</p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> Do you need to have a lot of information coming in to 
              you?</p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> Uh huh! I'm an addicted reader. My wife teases me because 
              I read in the shower, when I'm shaving. I read incessantly. I need 
              to be reading a lot. A lot of what I write&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;I hope 
              it's not too bookish&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;comes from other books. When 
              I was younger I was too allusive a writer. Not in a self-conscious 
              way, but it was the natural way things came to me. One of the things 
              I have been struggling to do is not to need that much allusion. 
              I'm trying all the time to be a much simpler writer. And that's 
              a hard thing to do. When I was writing the Thurber introduction, 
              I had this moment of revelation when I realized that Thurber writes 
              almost uniformly with one or two syllable words. </p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> There's lot's to say about this book... a final thought?</p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> I tried to give the book a certain structure&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;not 
              so much the structure of a story unfolding&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;but 
              of a set of emotions developing. The moral of the book is meant 
              to be fairly clear. Which is that you have to take civilizations 
              and people whole. You cannot make them be what you want them to 
              be. The struggle between civilization and culture, in France is 
              meant to be resolved at the end by saying, &quot;You can't have 
              the civilization without the culture. You can't have the little 
              shops without the big buildings. That's the nature of existence. 
              You take things whole.&quot; The reason French life gives you so 
              many positive libidinal yes's is because there are so many damning 
              no's around it, too. Through all the vignettes that's the moral 
              of the story, the theme of the pudding. I worry that it's easy to 
              miss in this kaleidoscope of French moments. I meant it to have 
              another moral. This is the thing about the birth of my daughter. 
              As long as you still have new consciousnesses in the world then 
              old things never get old. As long as there are new people to see 
              them, they remain new. I wanted the book to have these two governing 
              notions or feelings at the end of it. It's not meant to be a travel 
              book to make you go to Paris. It's about the experience of a different 
              place. It's really about...</p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> You.</p>
            <p> <b>AG:</b> Yeah. It's about me. It's also about difference. What 
              would it be like to live differently. </p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> You seemed to have handled the challenges of Paris so 
              gracefully. I would have been pulling my hair out.</p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> I was pulling my hair out, I must say that the urbane 
              and organized person on the page is a persona very different from 
              the...</p>
            <p><b>RB:</b> Something to aspire to...</p>
            <p><b>AG:</b> Yes, the reason to write. So that the annoyed, bad-tempered, 
              morose person at four in the morning is exorcised.</p>
