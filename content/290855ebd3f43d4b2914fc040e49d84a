The text <i>Linear Algebra</i> is free for downloading,
It covers the material of a first undergraduate Linear Algebra course.
You can use it either as a main text,
as a supplement to another text, or for independent study.

<h3>
  What's <i>Linear Algebra</i> About?
</h3>
    <p>
    When I started teaching the subject I found three kinds of texts.
    There were applied mathematics books that avoid proofs and   
    covered the linear algebra only
    as needed for their applications. 
    There were advanced books that assumed students could
    understand their elegant proofs and also understand how to 
    answer the homework questions having seen only one or two examples.
    And, there were books that spent a good part of the semester
    doing elementary things such as 
    multiplying matrices and computing determinants, only to suddenly 
    change level to working with definitions and proofs.
    </p>

    <p>
    Each of these three types was
    a problem in my classroom.
    The applications were interesting but I wanted to
    focus on the linear algebra.
    The advanced books were beautiful but my students were not ready
    for them.
    And, the level-switching books  
    resulted in a great deal of grief.
    </p>

    <p>
    I took a level-switching book as an undergraduate, 
    so I understood the struggle my students had with this. 
    At the start of the semester they thought 
    that these were like calculus books, 
    where
    material labelled `proof' should be skipped in favor of 
    the computational examples.
    Then, when the level switched, 
    no amount of discussion on my part 
    could convince students to switch with it, 
    and the semester ended unhappily. 
    </p>

    <p>
    That is, while
    I wish I could say that my students now perform at the level
    of the advanced books,
    I cannot.
    However, as a teacher I <i>can</i> work steadily to 
    bring them up to it over the course of our undergraduate program.
    This means stepping back from focussing on rote computations 
    in favor of focussing on an understanding of the mathematics.
    It means proving things and having students
    understand, e.g., that matrix
    multiplication is the application of a linear function.
    But it means also avoiding an approach that is too advanced for the
    students: the presentation must emphasize motivation,
    must have many illustrative examples, 
    and must include exercises with many
    of the medium-difficult questions that are a challenge to a learner without
    being overwhelming.
    And, it means communicating to my students that the change of focus is 
    what we are up to, right from the start.

    <h4>
    Summary Points
    </h4>

    <ul>
      <li> <b>The coverage is standard:</b>
        linear systems and Gauss' method, 
	vector spaces, linear maps and matrices, determinants,
	and eigenvectors and eigenvalues.
	The <a href="toc.html">Table of Contents</a>
        gives you a quick overview.

      <li> <b>Prerequisites.</b>
        A semester of calculus.
        Students with three semesters of calculus can skip a few sections.

      <li> <b>Applications.</b>
        Each chapter has three or four discussions of 
	additional topics and applications.
        These are suitable for independent study or for
        small group work. 
 
       <li> <b>What makes it different?</b>
         The approach is developmental. 
	 Although the presentation is focused on covering the requisite 
         material by proving things,
	 it does not start with an assumption that 
	 students are already able at abstract work.
	 Instead, it proceeds with a great deal of
	 motivation, many computational examples, 
         and exercises that range from 
	 routine verifications to (a few) challenges.
	 The goal is, 
	 in the context of developing the usual material of an
	 undergraduate linear algebra course, to help raise the level of 
	 mathematical maturity of the class.
      </ul>

    <p>
    I know of only two reviews. 
    <a href="http://www.theassayer.org/cgi-bin/asbook.cgi?book=29">One</a>
    is at a site for free texts.
    <a href="http://www.randomhacks.net/articles/2007/03/07/hefferon-linear-algebra-review">The other</a>
    is a blog, I believe.
    (Also, someone posted a link to this page on the math sub-reddit, so there are <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/6tlou/a_legally_free_linear_algebra_textbook/">a number of comments</a>.)

        You need to know LaTeX and MetaPost
        to work with it, although there is a

<h3>
  If you are an instructor thinking of adopting  <i>Linear Algebra</i> 
</h3>
<p>
For a quick look, 
I suggest the second chapter.
The first chapter is necessarily 
computational but 
the second chapter shows more clearly what the book works on:&nbsp;bridging 
between lower-division mathematics with its
reliance on explicitly-given algorithms, and upper division 
college mathematics with its emphasis on concepts and proof.
</p>

<p>
The text has been class-tested here and elsewhere
and I'm delighted to have it 
on student's desks, doing what it is for.
Running off double-sided copies and 
comb-binding them costs students around $20.00 (we include the
Preface, Table of Contents, Appendix, and Index to make about 450 pages. 
With the Answers to Exercises at about 215 pages the total is about $25.00.

<h3>
  Can You Help With <i>Linear Algebra</i>?
</h3>
    <p>
     In addition to the book, the answers to the exercises, and the
     source,
     you can get some materials that were 
     <a href="contrib.html">contributed</a> 
     by others.
     If you in turn have something that you are able to share 
     please write me.
     I have gotten comments ranging from a suggestion 
     about a better way to
     prove a result or make an example, to an entire Topic.
     In particular, I would welcome used exams or problem sets,
     especially if you can contribute the TeX or LaTeX source, so that a
     user could cut or paste.
     (Some instructors have expressed reservations about using a text 
     where the answers to the exercises are downloadable, so more exercises
     would be helpful.)
     Naturally, all contributions will be gratefully 
     acknowledged,
     or anonymous if you like.
