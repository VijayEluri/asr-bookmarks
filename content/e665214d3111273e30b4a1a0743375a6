<hr><h3>BeanShell JSR Passes!</h3><body>
<a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=274">JSR-274</a> 
the BeanShell Scripting Language, has 
<a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/results?id=3208">passed the voting process</a>
with flying colors.  This means that we will
proceed with forming the expert group to write a language specification and
work towards getting BeanShell included in the J2SE at some point in the
future.  Some <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/pat/archive/2005/05/jsr274_standard_1.html">comments</a> on the initiating the JSR can be found in Pat Niemeyer's
blog on java.net.
</body><p></p><hr><h3>BeanShell Community Wiki Opens!</h3><body>
I'm pleased to announce the opening of the 
<a href="http://beanshell.ikayzo.org/docs/">BeanShell Community Wiki</a>.
This is the first step in our migration to our new hosting site on <a href="http://ikayzo.org">Ikayzo.org</a>.  There's not much there yet, but we expect
you all to take care of that right away!
</body><p></p><hr><h3>BeanShell at JavaOne 2005</h3><body>
Join us for a BeanShell BOF session at JavaOne, 2005.  The talk is tentatively
titled <em><b>"The Future of BeanShell and Java Compatible Scripting"</b></em>.
We'll also be cooperating with the JSR-223 session on the new 
<b>javax.script</b> API which will be bundled with an upcoming J2SE release.
</body><p></p><hr><h3>BeanShell 2.0 beta 1 Released!</h3><body>
With version 2.0 BeanShell becomes a fully Java compatible scripting language.
BeanShell is now capable of interpreting ordinary Java source and loading .java
source files from the class path.  BeanShell scripted classes are fully typed
and appear to outside Java code and via reflective inspection as ordinary
classes.  However their implementation is fully dynamic and they may include
arbitrary BeanShell scripts in their bodies, methods, and constructors.  Users
may now freely mix loose, unstructured BeanShell scripts, method closures, and
full scripted classes.  Please see the 
<a href="bsh20announce.txt">announcement</a> for details and known bugs
in the initial release.
</body><p></p><hr><h3>BeanShell Support in Ant 1.5 and IBM Bean Scripting Framework
2.3</h3><body>
With version 1.5 Ant now provides explicit support for BeanShell as a
pluggable scripting language via the BSF.  Ironically, as of version 2.3 BSF now
adds BeanShell support by registering it as one of its "well known"
scripting languages.  This means that you can use BeanShell in Ant 1.5 and 

also in any BSF aware application with BSF 2.3 (confusing enough?)
</body><p></p><hr><h3>BEA Weblogic Shipping Beanshell with Weblogic Application Server
6.x</h3><body>
I am happy to announce that 
<a href="http://www.bea.com/">Weblogic</a> will be making use of the 
LGPL/SPL licensing and shipping BeanShell with the Weblogic Server.
</body><p></p><hr><h3>Sun to Ship Beanshell with Forte for Java</h3><body>
I am pleased to officially announce that Sun will be shipping BeanShell
with an upcoming release of 
<a href="http://www.sun.com/forte/">Forte for Java</a> and will make it
available in the <a href="http://www.netbeans.org">NetBeans IDE</a>. 
To facilitate this BeanShell has moved
to a dual licensing arrangement. You may now opt to use BeanShell under
the terms of the Sun Public License, or you may (as always) continue to
use and develop BeanShell under the terms of the LGPL.
</body><p></p><hr><h3>BeanShell in the News</h3><body>
Check out the July 2000 edition of the Java Developer's Journal for a ten page
<a href="http://www.sys-con.com/java/article.cfm?id=881">
article about BeanShell and Dynamic Java</a>.  I'm also happy to announce
that BeanShell is now included with my book 
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/learnjava/">
