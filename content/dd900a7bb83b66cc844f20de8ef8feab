    <H1>iftop: display bandwidth usage on an interface</H1>

    <p>
iftop does for network usage what top(1) does for CPU usage.  It listens to
network traffic on a named interface and displays a table of current bandwidth
usage by pairs of hosts.  Handy for answering the question "why is our ADSL
link so slow?".

    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>libpcap</li>

      </ul>

    <h2>Download</h2>
    <P>
The latest stable version of iftop is 0.17.  Older and newer
(pre-release) version are available from the <a
href="download/?M=D">downloads directory</a>.  I am always keen to hear of
any problems with the latest pre-release versions (that's what they're
there for) so please do try them.  N.B. these are versioned as
pre-releases, so 0.17 is the final release, and comes after 0.17pre*
    </p>
    <p>
Download: <A HREF="download/iftop-0.17.tar.gz">iftop-0.17.tar.gz</A> or <a href="download/iftop-1.0pre1.tar.gz">iftop-1.0pre1.tar.gz</a>.

    <h2>Change log</h2>
    <p>
The change log for iftop is available <a href="cvs/iftop/ChangeLog">here</a>.
This may contain items for changes to be included in the next release of iftop.
If there's no release date against the latest version, that's because it hasn't
been released yet.  You may be able to get it as a pre-release from the <a href="download/?M=D">download area</a>
    </p>
    <h2>Mailing list</h2>
    <p>
There is now a <a
href="http://lists.beasts.org/mailman/listinfo/iftop-users">mailing list</a>
for iftop.  This list will be used for announcements of new versions of iftop,
including pre-release versions.  Please send any queries you have about iftop
to the mailing list and not to me personally.  Please be aware that this is a
public mailing list, and I will not be responsible for your email making its
way onto the big bad InterWeb(tm).  Specifically, I do not guarantee that the <a
href="http://lists.beasts.org/pipermail/iftop-users/">publicly available
archives</a> will continue to obscure email addresses of subscribers as I do
not believe that this is a particularly useful thing to do.
    </p>
    <h2>Patches and contributions</h2>
    <p>

Patches are always very welcome, and I try to give credit appropriately.
Please note that my default policy with all patches is to include your
name and email address in the ChangeLog file.  If you're submitting a
patch and don't want this, please say so.  When fixing bugs, credit
typically goes to the first person to find and fix a problem even if the
patch ends up being re-written before inclusion.
