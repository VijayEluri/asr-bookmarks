  <p>Exmap is a memory analysis tool which allows you to accurately
  determine how much physical memory and swap is used by individual
  processes and shared libraries on a running system. In particular,
  it accounts for the sharing of memory and swap between different
  processes.
  </p>

  <p>To my knowledge, other tools can determine that some memory is
  shared, but can't determine how many processes are making use of
  that memory and so fairly apportion the cost between the processes
  making use of it.</p>
  
  <p>Exmap uses a loadable kernel module to assign a unique id to each
  physical or swap page in use by each process. This information is
  then collated and 'effective' usage numbers calculated. A GTK
  program is provided to view the information (and a command line tool
  is planned for a future release).
  </p>

  <p>Basically, this allows you to examine a complex system of
  processes and determine the effective memory usage of each process,
  mapped file, ELF section and ELF symbol, which can be helpful in
  memory optimisation work.</p>
