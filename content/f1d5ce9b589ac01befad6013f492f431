<p>This is a draft book titled <i>A Little Ruby, A Lot of
Objects</i>. It's in the style of Friedman and Felleisen's wonderful
<i>The Little Lisper</i> (now called <a
href="http://www1.fatbrain.com/asp/bookinfo/bookinfo.asp?theisbn=0262560992&&from=TBJ817"><i>The
Little Schemer</i></a>), but on a different topic.
From the preface:
<blockquote>
<p>
Welcome to my little book. In it, my goal is to teach you a way to
think about computation, to show you how far you can take a simple
idea: that all computation consists of sending messages to
objects. Object-oriented programming is no longer unusual, but taking
it to the extreme - making <i>everything</i> an object - is still supported
by only a few programming languages.  
</p>
<p>
Can I justify this book in practical terms? Will reading it make you a better programmer, even if you never use "call with current continuation" or indulge in "metaclass hackery"? I think it might, but perhaps only if you're the sort of person who would read this sort of book even if it had no practical value. 
</p>
<p>
The real reason for reading this book is that the ideas in it are
<i>neat</i>. There's an intellectual heritage here, a history of people
building idea upon idea. It's an academic heritage, but not in the
fussy sense. It's more a joyous heritage of tinkerers, of people
buttonholing their friends and saying, "You know, if I take <i>that</i> and
think about it like <i>this</i>, look what I can do!" 
</p>
