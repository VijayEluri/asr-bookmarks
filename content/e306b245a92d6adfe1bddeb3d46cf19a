            <p onclick="SPN(this);" onmouseover="SPL(this);" onmouseout="HPL(this);">It's hard to believe Google - which is now the world's largest single online marketplace - came on the scene only a little
               more than 8 years ago, back in the days when Amazon and Ebay reigned supreme. So how did Google become the world's single
               largest marketplace?
            </p>
            
            <p onclick="SPN(this);" onmouseover="SPL(this);" onmouseout="HPL(this);">Well, the short answer is “the Semantic Web” (whatever that is - more in a moment). While Amazon and Ebay continue to have
               average quarterly profits of $1 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, and are successes by any measure, the $17 billion
               per annum Google Marketplace is clearly the most impressive success story of what used to be called, pre-crash, “The New Economy.”
            </p>
            
            <p onclick="SPN(this);" onmouseover="SPL(this);" onmouseout="HPL(this);">Amazon and Ebay both worked as virtual marketplaces: they outsourced as much inventory as possible (in Ebay's case, of course,
               that was <i>all</i> the inventory, but Amazon also kept as little stock on hand as it could). Then, through a variety of methods, each brought
               together buyers and sellers, taking a cut of every transaction.
            </p>
            
            <p onclick="SPN(this);" onmouseover="SPL(this);" onmouseout="HPL(this);">For Amazon, that meant selling new items, or allowing thousands of users to sell them used. For Ebay, it meant bringing together
               auctioneers and auction buyers. Once you got everything started, this approach was extremely profitable. It was fast. It was
               managed by phone calls, emails, and database applications. It worked.
            </p>
            
            <p onclick="SPN(this);" onmouseover="SPL(this);" onmouseout="HPL(this);">Enter Google. By 2002, it was <i>the</i> search engine, and its ad sales were picking up. At the same time, the concept of the “Semantic Web,” which had been around
               since 1998 or so, was gaining a little traction, and the attention of an increasing circle of people.
            </p>
            
            <p onclick="SPN(this);" onmouseover="SPL(this);" onmouseout="HPL(this);">So what's the Semantic Web? At its heart, it's just a way to describe things in a way that a computer can “understand.” Of
               course, what's going on is not understanding, but logic, like you learn in high school:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>
               
               
               
               <p onclick="SPN(this);" onmouseover="SPL(this);" onmouseout="HPL(this);">If A is a friend of B, then B is a friend of A.</p>

               <p onclick="SPN(this);" onmouseover="SPL(this);" onmouseout="HPL(this);">Therefore, Paul has a friend named Jim.</p>
               
               
               
               <p onclick="SPN(this);" onmouseover="SPL(this);" onmouseout="HPL(this);">Jim has a friend named Paul.</p>
               
               
               <p onclick="SPN(this);" onmouseover="SPL(this);" onmouseout="HPL(this);">Therefore, Paul has a friend named Jim.</p>
               
               
            </blockquote>
            
            <p onclick="SPN(this);" onmouseover="SPL(this);" onmouseout="HPL(this);">Using a markup language called RDF (an acronym that's here to stay, so you might as well learn it - it stands for Resource
               Description Framework), you could put logical statements like these on the Internet, “spiders” could collect them, and the
               statements could be searched, analyzed, and processed. What makes this different than regular search is that the statements
               can be combined. So if I find a statement on Jim's web site that says “Jim is a friend of Paul” and someone does a search
               for Paul's friends, even if Paul's web site doesn't have a mention of Jim on it, we <b>know</b> Jim's considers himself a friend of Paul.
            </p>
            
            <p onclick="SPN(this);" onmouseover="SPL(this);" onmouseout="HPL(this);">Other things we might know for sure? That Car Seller A is selling Miatas for 10% less than Car Seller B. That Jan Hammer played
               keyboards on the Mahavishnu Orchestra's albums in the 1970s. That dogs have paws. That your specific model of computer requires
               a new motherboard and a faster bus before it can be upgraded to a Pentium 18. The Semantic Web isn't about pages and links,
               it's about relationships between things - whether one thing is a part of another, or how much a thing costs, or when it happened.
            </p>
            
            <p onclick="SPN(this);" onmouseover="SPL(this);" onmouseout="HPL(this);">The Semweb was originally supposed to give the web the “smarts” it lacked - and much of the early work on it was in things
               like calendaring and scheduling, and in expressing relationships between people. By late 2003, when Google began to seriously
               experiment with the Semweb (after two years of experiments at their research labs), it was still a slow-growing technology
               that almost no one understood and very few people used, except for academics with backgrounds in logic, computer science,
               or artificial intelligence. The learning curve was as steep as a cliff, and there wasn't a great incentive for new coders
               to climb it and survey the world from their new vantage.
            </p>
            
            <p onclick="SPN(this);" onmouseover="SPL(this);" onmouseout="HPL(this);">The Semweb, it was promised, would make it much easier to schedule dentist's appointment, update your computer, check the
               train schedule, and coordinate shipments of car parts. It would make searching for things easier. All great stuff, stuff to
               make millions of dollars from, perhaps. But not exactly sexy to the people who write the checks, especially after they'd been
               burnt 95 times over by the dot-com bust. All they saw was the web - the same web that had lined a few pockets and emptied
               a few million - with the word “semantic” in front of it.

            <p onclick="SPN(this);" onmouseover="SPL(this);" onmouseout="HPL(this);">The semantics of something is the <i>meaning</i> of it. Nebulous stuff, but in the world of AI, the goal has long been getting semantics out of syntax. See, the trillion
               dollar question is, when you have a whole lot of stuff arranged syntactically, in a given structure that the computer can
               chew up, how do you then get <i>meaning</i> out of it? How does syntax become semantics? Human brains are really good at this, but computers, are dreadful. They're whizzes
               at syntax. You can tell them anything, if you tell it in a structured way, but they can't make sense of it, they keep deciding
               that “The flesh is willing but the spirit is weak” in English translates to “The meat is full of stars but the vodka is made
               of pinking shears” or suchlike in Russian.
            </p>
            
            <p onclick="SPN(this);" onmouseover="SPL(this);" onmouseout="HPL(this);">So the guess has always been that you need a whole lot of syntactically stable statements in order to come up with anything
               interesting. In fact, you need a whole brain's worth - millions. Now, no one has proved this approach works at all, and the
               #1 advocate for this approach was a man named Doug Lenat of the CYC corporation, who somehow ended up on President Ashcroft's
               post-coup blacklist as a dangerous intellectual and hasn't been seen since. But the basic, overarching idea with the Semweb
               was - and still is, really - to throw together so much syntax from so many people that there's a chance to generate meaning
               out of it all.
            </p>
            
            <p onclick="SPN(this);" onmouseover="SPL(this);" onmouseout="HPL(this);">As you know, computers still aren't listening to us as well as we'd like, but in the meantime the Semweb technology matured,
               and all of a sudden centralized databases - and Amazon and Ebay were prime examples of centralized databases with millions
               of items each - could suddenly be spread out through the entire web. Everyone could own their little piece of the database,
               their own part of the puzzle. It was easy to publish the stuff. But the problem was that there was no good way to bring it
               all together. And it was hard to create RDF files, even for some programmers - so we're back to that steep learning curve.

            <p onclick="SPN(this);" onmouseover="SPL(this);" onmouseout="HPL(this);">That all changed - suprisingly slowly - in late 2004, when with little fanfare, Google introduced three services, <b>Google Marketplace Search</b>, <b>Google Personal Agent</b>, and <b>Google Verification Manager</b>, and a software product, <b>Google Marketplace Manager</b>.

               from Google's “classic,” non-Semantic-Web search tools, long considered the best on the Web, to link to information on Martin
               models and buyer's guides, as well as from Google's Usenet News archive. Links to sites like Epinions filled in the gaps.

               the like, we'll skip that part and just focus on the essential fact: everything on the Semantic Web describes something that
               has a URL. Or a URI. Or something like that. What that really means is that RDF is data about web data - or metadata. Sometimes
               RDF describes other RDF. So do you see how you take all those syntactic statements and hope to build a <i>semantic</i> web, one that can figure things out for itself? Combining the statements like that? Do you? Come on now, really? Yeah, well
               no one does.

            <p onclick="SPN(this);" onmouseover="SPL(this);" onmouseout="HPL(this);">Well, first you need the information. Asking people to simply throw it on a server seemed like chaos - so enter <b>Google Marketplace Manager</b>, a small piece of software for Windows, Unix, and Macintosh (this is before Apple bought Spain and renamed it the Different-thinking
               Capitalist Republic of Information). The Marketplace Manager, or MM, looked like a regular spreadsheet and allowed you to
               list information about yourself, what you wanted to sell, what you wanted to buy, and so forth. MM was essentially an “logical
               statement editor,” disguised as a spreadsheet. People entered their names, addresses, and other relevant information about
               themselves, then they entered what they were selling, and MM saved RDF-formatted files to the server of their choice - and
               sent a “ping” to Google which told the search engine to update their index.
            </p>
            
            <p onclick="SPN(this);" onmouseover="SPL(this);" onmouseout="HPL(this);">When it came out, the MM was a little bit magical. Let's say you wanted to sell a book. You entered “Book” in the category
               and MM queried the Open Product Taxonomy, then came back and asked you to identify whether it was a hardcover book, softcover,
               used, new, collectible, and so forth. The Open Product Taxonomy is a structured thesaurus, essentially, of product types,
               and it's quickly becoming the absolute standard for representing products for sale.

            <p onclick="SPN(this);" onmouseover="SPL(this);" onmouseout="HPL(this);">Then you enter an ISBN number from the back of the book, hit return, and the MM automatically fills in the author, copyright,
               number of pages, and a field for notes - it just queries a server for the RDF, gets it, chews it up, and gives it to you.
               If you were a small publishing house, you could list your catalog. If you had a first edition <i>Grapes of Wrath</i> you could describe it and give it a lowest acceptable price, and it'd appear in Google Auctions. Most of the smarts in the
               MM were actually on the server, as Google interpreted what was entered and adapted the spreadsheet around it. If you entered
               car, it asked for color. If you entered wine, it asked for vintage, vineyard, number of bottles. Then, when someone searched
               for 1998 Merlot, your bottle was high on the list.

               but the MM was sweet and fast and optimized. When you bought something, it was listed in your “purchases” column, organized
               by type of purchase - easy to print out for your accountant, nice for your records.

               and avoid the 1.75%, but for most items that was your best bet - fast and cheap. 1.75% plus advertising and a global reach,
               and you can count on millions flowing smoothly through your accounts.

               compelled consumers to bring their business to the web, the word-of-mouth began to work its magic. Since it was easy to search
               for things to buy, and easy to download the MM and get started, the number of people actively looking through Google Marketplace
