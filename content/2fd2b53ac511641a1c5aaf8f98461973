<h1>A Web Server Called <em>Ebb</em></h1>

<p>Ebb aims to be a small and fast web server specifically for hosting 
dynamic Ruby language web applications. </p>

<p>It is a binding to <a href="http://tinyclouds.org/libebb">libebb</a></p>

<h2>Install</h2>

<p>The Ruby binding is available as a Ruby Gem. It can be install by executing</p>

<pre><code>gem install ebb
</code></pre>

<p>If you want SSL support you must install GnuTLS.
Ebb has no other dependencies.</p>

<h2>Running</h2>

<p>Use Ebb.start_server()</p>

<h2>Speed</h2>

<p>(these stats are out of date)</p>

<p>Because Ebb handles most of the processing in C, it is able to do work
often times more efficiently than other Ruby language web servers.</p>

<p>Ebb-Ruby can handle threaded processing better than the other 'evented' 
servers. This won't be of any benefit to Rails applications because Rails
places a lock around each request that wouldn't allow concurrent processing
anyway. In Merb, for example, Ebb's thread handling will allow Ebb instances
to handle larger loads. <a href="http://four.livejournal.com/848525.html">More</a></p>
