Abstract
</H1>
</CENTER> <P>

While the quality of the results of TeX's
mathematical formula layout algorithm is convincing,
its original description is hard to understand
since it is presented as
an imperative program with complex control flow and
destructive manipulations
of the data structures representing formulae.
In this paper, we present a re-implementation of TeX's
formula layout algorithm in the functional language SML,
thereby providing a more readable description of the algorithm,
extracted from the monolithical TeX system.
