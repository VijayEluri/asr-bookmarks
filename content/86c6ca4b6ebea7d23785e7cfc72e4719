            <h1>Why WebNano</h1>

<p>Many web applications have common components: a login page, a comment box,
an email confirmation mechanism, a generic CRUD page.  All of these are
well-defined components.  It's easy to believe that it should not be difficult
to abstract them away into libraries.  Yet every time you start a web
application you need to write that boring comment box again and again.</p>

<p>Why are there so few such libraries?  Why is writing them so hard?  There
are more and less important reasons, but there are many reasons.  Most projects
to make components eventually die the death of a thousand cuts.  Some of those problems can be solved and I believe that solving them would make a difference. <a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?WebNano">WebNano</a> is my attempt at
doing that.<p>

<p>Probably the most popular Perl web framework is <a
    href="http://catalystframework.org/">Catalyst</a>.  It is also the web
framework I know the best&mdash;this is why I chose it as the point of
reference for my analysis.</p>

<h2><strong>Controllers in request scope</strong></h2>

<p>Five years ago I was staring at the first Catalyst examples and had foggy
intuition that there was something not quite optimal.  The essence of object
oriented programming is that the most accessed data should be available to all
methods in a class without explicitly passing it via parameters, but the
Catalyst examples always started with <code>my ( $self, $c, ... ) = @_</code>.
That's not very <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DontRepeatYourself">DRY</a>.
The <code>$c</code> parameter gets passed everywhere as if it were a plain old
parameter.</p>

<p>At some point I <a
    href="http://perlalchemy.blogspot.com/2009/10/catalystcomponentinstancepercontext.html">counted
    how often methods from the manual use the controller object versus how
    often they use the context object which contains the request data</a>.  The
result was 117 and 38 respectively.  Many people commented that their code
often uses the controller object.  It's hard to judge this unless you can see
that code, but as my code resembled the example code from the manual, this
seems common.  This disproportion is only an illustration.  The question is not
about switching <code>$c</code> with <code>$self</code>. The question is why
the request data, which undeniably is in the center of the computation carried
out in controllers, is anything other than instance data.</p>

<p>My curiosity persisted until about a year ago, when I received a reply in
private communication from some members of the core team.  They want the
controller object to be immutable (see <a
    href="http://blog.woobling.org/2009/05/immutable-data-structures.html">Immutable
    Data Structures</a>).  That's impossible if the values of one or more of
its attributesmust necessarily change with each incoming request.  Immutable
objects are a good design choice and I accepted this answer but later I
wondered what would happen if the framework recreated the controller object
anew with each request?  Then it could hold the request data and still be
immutable for the lifetime of the request.</p>

<p>This would be a big change for Catalyst; Catalyst controllers are created at
the starup time, together with all the other application components (models and
views) and changing that does not seem feasible.  I decided to write a new web
framework.</p>

<p>I have tried many Perl web frameworks but I found only one more that uses
controllers in request scope.  This is a fundamental distinguishing feature of
WebNano.  It's not only about reducing the clutter of repeatable parameter
passing.  Instead, I believe that putting object into their natural scope will
fix a lot of the widely recognized <a
    href="http://jjnapiorkowski.vox.com/library/post/does-anyone-else-hate-the-stash.html">problems
    with the Catalyst stash and data passed through it</a>.  In procedural
programming it is not controversial to put your variable declarations into the
narrowest block that encompasses their uses.  The same should be true for
objects.  Using the same controller to serve multiple request <em>is</em> a bit
faster then recreating it each time, but that gain is modest.  <a
    href="http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/7c61aa08-d810-11df-8503-f91d06264d1f">Object::Tiny
    on one of the tester machines could create 714286 object per second</a> and
even <a href="http://moose.perl.org/">Moose</a>, the slowest framework tested
there, can create more then a 10000 objects per second.  Eliminating a few of
such operations, in most circumstances, is not worth compromising on the
architecture.</p>

<p>I also tested these theoretical estimations with more down to earth <a
    href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/ab.html">ab</a> benchmarks
for a trivial application serving just one page.  WebNano was the fasted
framework tested, by a wide margin.  This is still an artificial test, but it
should be accurate enough to show that the cost introduced by this design
choice does not need to be big.</p>

<h2><strong>Decoupling</strong></h2>

<p>WebNano may have tested as the fastest framework because it does not do
much.  WebNano is really small. Its <em>lib/</em> directory currently contains
just 233 lines of code (as reported by <a
    href="http://www.dwheeler.com/sloccount/">sloccount</a>) and <a
    href="http://deps.cpantesters.org/?module=WebNano;perl=latest">minimal
    dependencies</a>.  CPAN libraries cover all corners of web application
programming, so WebNano can provide a basic structure and otherwise get out of
the way.  Assuming simplicity allowed me to remove a lot of code required for
advanced flexibility.</p>

<p>For example, Catalyst started the process of decoupling the web framework
from other parts of the application. With Catalyst you can use any persistence
layer for the model and any templating library for the view.  Yet with this
flexibility the <code>model()</code> and <code>view()</code> methods in
Catalyst are very simple.  There is no common behaviour among the various
libraries, so all these methods do is find a model or view by its name.  For
WebNano I decided that <code>-&gt;Something</code> is shorter and no less
informative then <code>-&gt;model('Something')</code>, so I removed the
<code>model()</code> and <code>view()</code> methods.</p>

<p>I also decided to leave out component initialization.  This is a generic
task used in all kinds of programs.  Any library which performs this task needs
to know nothing about the web part of the application, and CPAN offers many
such initialization libraries.  In my limited experiments <a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/MooseX-SimpleConfig/">MooseX::SimpleConfig</a>
was very convenient. For more complex needs, <a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Bread-Board/">Bread::Board</a> seems like
a good choice.  This initialization layer needs to know how to create all the
objects used by the application, but you need no WebNano adapter to use
them.</p>

<h2><strong>Localized dispatching</strong></h2>

<p>Out of the box WebNano supports only one very simple dispatching model.
Dispatching controls which subroutine to call with which arguments and depends
directly on the behavior of the subroutines themselves.  This is why I don't
believe in external dispatchers where you configure all the dispatching for the
application in one place.  The dispatching might be in one place, but any
practical change you make requires updates in two places.  WebNano's default
dispatching is easy to extend and override on per-controller basis.</p>

<p>Writing a dispatcher is not hard; it's only complex and difficult when you
try to write a dispatching model to work for every possible application.  I
prefer to write a simple dispatcher covering only the most popular dispatching
scenarios and let the users of my framework write any specialized dispatching
code for specialized controllers. With WebNano this is possible because these
specialized dispatchers don't interfere with each other.</p>

<p>I also believe that this will make the controller classes more encapsulated
and facilitate building libraries of application controllers.</p>

<h2><strong>Granularity</strong></h2>

<p>I like the way Catalyst structures your web related code into controller
classes. This is a step forward from the <a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/~markstos/CGI-Application-4.31/lib/CGI/Application.pm">CGI::Application</a>
way of packing everything into one class.  I have no hard data to support my
impression, but the granularity of packing a few related pages into one
controller class feels just about right.  It gives room for expansion by adding
new classes and dividing existing ones, and it does not clutter the application
code with several nearly empty classes.  This is a very important feature.  I
copied this design wholeheartedly in WebNano.</p>

<h2><strong>Experiments with inheritance and overriding</strong></h2>

<p>One of the WebNano tests is an application which subclasses the main test
app.  It passes all the original tests and could be completely empty if I did
not want to test the overriding of the inherited parts.  I have seen many times
a need for such behaviour, from branding websites to SaaS to reusable intranet
tools.  Too many applications solve the problem of reuse by copying code.
Inheritance has its problems, but it enables ad-hoc reuse better than cut and
paste programming.</p>

<p>Be aware that you need to override much more than just methods.  My
experiment with WebNano overrides application parts: controllers, templates,
and configuration.  It also overrides individual controllers at the template
and method levels.</p>

<p>This type of inheritance could enable a natural mechanism to publish
applications to CPAN, because they could operate with no special installation.
Users could run them directly from <code>@INC</code> and only later override
the configuration or templates as needed.</p>

<h2><strong>Universality</strong></h2>

<p>In the most common case a web application serving a request needs to fetch
data, perform some computations on this data, and render a template with the
computed values.  Those tasks typically consume 99% of the overall time spent
serving a request. The other 1% of time spent in the application framework
processing matters little; reducing it will produce little noticeable speed
increase in the whole application.</p>

<p>Even so, there might be rare cases where the application needs to serve, for
example, small JSON data chunks from a memory cache. Even when this is a small
and simple part of the application, if it generates enough volume then the
speed of the framework suddenly becomes important. Would you code that part in
PHP?</p>

<p>I was very tempted to use Moose in WebNano.  Moose generates some
significant startup overhead, though for web applications running in persistent
environments this does not matter much because that overhead amortizes over
many requests. If you run your application as CGI, this startup time becomes
important.  Even if CGI is perceived as pass&eacute; now, it is still the
easiest way to deploy web applications and (especially with the most widespread
support from hosting companies).  Fortunately, using <a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?MooseX::NonMoose">MooseX::NonMoose</a>
it is very easy to treat any hash based object classes as base classes for
Moose based code, so using WebNano does not mean that you need to stick to the
simplistic Object Oriented Framework it uses.</p>

<p>The plan is to make WebNano small but universal, then make extensions that
will be more powerful and more restricted. I think it is important that the
base platform can be used in all kinds of circumstances.</p>

<h2><strong>Conclusions</strong></h2>

<p>It is early to say if WebNano will live to the promise of facilitating the
development of web application components.  There is a first component at CPAN:
<a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/WebNano-Controller-CRUD/">WebNano::Controller::CRUD</a>.
It still bears the label "experimental", but I used it in <a
    href="https://github.com/zby/Nblog">Nblog</a>.  When I compare it to my
first similar product <a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/~wreis/Catalyst-Example-InstantCRUD-0.037/lib/Catalyst/Example/Controller/InstantCRUD.pm">Catalyst::Example::Controller::InstantCRUD</a>,
there aren't many differences. As you might predict, the methods have one less
parameter (<code>$c</code>).  Inheritable templates are also nice for
deployment&mdash;you don't need to write your own templates to see it working,
and later you can easily override the defaults.  There is a bit more
dispatching code, but thanks to that, the code retrieves the result object in
only one place.  In Catalyst this is possible with chained dispatching.  In the

<a
    href="https://github.com/zby/WebNano/tree/master/examples/DvdDatabase/lib/DvdDatabase/Controller/">examples
    directory</a> there are four variations on this CRUD theme.  I remain
undecided about whis is optimal.</p>

<p>The surprising thing when converting Nblog from Catalyst to WebNano was how
little I missed the rich Catalyst features, even though WebNano has still so
little code.  I think it is a promising start.</p>

<p>Recently I discovered echoes of many of my design choices in the
publications by the Google testing guru <a
    href="http://misko.hevery.com/">Miško Hevery</a>.  My point of departure
for the considerations above were general rules such as decoupling and
encapsulation, where his concern is testability.  The resulting <a
    href="http://misko.hevery.com/2008/08/21/where-have-all-the-singletons-gone/">design
    without singletons</a> is remarkably similar.  There is a lot of good
articles at his blog, some were similar to what I already had considered (<a
    href="http://misko.hevery.com/2009/04/15/managing-object-lifetimes/">managing
    object lifetimes</a>) and others were completely new to me (<a
    href="http://misko.hevery.com/2009/04/08/how-to-do-everything-wrong-with-servlets/">how
    to do everything wrong with servlets</a>).  I recommend them all.</p>

<p><strong>You're a successful serial entrepreneur. How'd you get into
    Perl?</strong></p>

<p>I started my professional career as an Engineer at a TV station. As the web
started to get popular in the early 90's I started picking up web development
for the TV station, and then eventually went to work at an ISP as a web
developer and system administrator. That's when I first picked up Perl, as it
was already installed on the DEC Unix boxes they were running.  I realized how
easy it was to use it to automate a lot of my job (deploying sites, running
backups, collecting statistics, munging logs), and a little web stuff here and
there too (processing forms, writing message boards and polls). Since then I've
used several other languages (PHP, Java, and Ruby mostly), but I always come
back to Perl because it solves the most problems for me with the littlest
amount of fuss.</p>

<p><strong>What's your business background?</strong></p>

<p>I have no formal business training, but I've worked at lots of companies
big and small, and either started or helped start about a dozen companies
now, four of which I still own. So I've really picked up a lot of my
business expertise through trial and error, and through watching the
successes and failures of other businesses.</p>

<p>Some people follow sports and can quote you the scores and statistics of
their favorite teams. For me, I prefer to watch businesses and business
leaders. And when I read for entertainment, it's almost never fiction.
Instead I like to read about things that can give me ideas to apply. For
instance, I just finished "The Viral Loop," which covers viral marketing
history from Tupperware through Facebook. I know all this sounds pretty
nerdy/geeky/dorky, but so be it.</p>

<p><strong>How did you decide to do a browser-based game?</strong></p>

<p>Actually long before I built <a href="http://webgui.org/">WebGUI</a>, in the
CGI era, I built one of the very first web-based RPG systems. It was called
Survival of the Fittest. And back about that time I had the idea for The Lacuna
Expanse (it was called Star Games back then), but the technology wasn't there
to pull off what I really wanted to do.</p>

<p>Then last year (released July 14, 2009) I built a new business called <a
href="http://thegamecrafter.com/">The Game Crafter</a>. It is a web to
print company, where people design board games and card games using their
web browser (plus some offline image editing) and when they're done, they
can order a copy for themselves, or put it up in our online store to sell
to potential customers. It's sort of like <a
href="http://lulu.com/">Lulu</a> or <a
href="http://cafepress.com">CafePress</a>, but for traditional board and
card games. Here we are just over a year later and that business has really
taken off, with over 1,500 people making custom games, and 70% of customers
returning for more than one order. I should mention that TGC is built with
100% pure Perl as well.</p>

<p>About the time that The Game Crafter launched, another business that I
had created four years earlier started actually making some good money.
That business is <a href="http://cmsmatrix.org/">CMS Matrix</a>, and yes
it's 100% pure Perl as well.</p>

<p>After about 6 months of seeing how well The Game Crafter and CMS Matrix
were doing, and knowing that I had a solid team in place to keep WebGUI
marching forward, my business partners and I decided we should take a
chance with yet another business. But this time we decided we wanted to
tackle something much more ambitious and risky.</p>

<p>One of my business partners reminded me of the Star Games idea. And
there's hardly anything more risky than making a video game. It has a large
up front cost of both time and money, and video games pretty much either
make a lot of money, or none at all. There's not much of a middle of the
road. With Star Games as our foundation, we started designing game
mechanics. We didn't want to build yet another war game (too many of those)
so we settled on espionage as our conflict mechanism. And until WoW and The
Sims came around, there was one game that dominated the landscape as far as
revenue goes, SimCity. So we knew the game had to have a city building
element. And everything else was stuff we either made up, or ideas we
borrowed from our favorite games.</p>

<p><strong>What did you have to invent and what did you reuse?</strong></p>

<p>Luckily CPAN came to the rescue as it has on basically every Perl
project I've ever tackled. So I was able to not have to reinvent the wheel
on basically any foundational level. Here's the list of Perl modules I

</ul>

<p>When I first started development I was convinced that to be massively
parallel I was going to have to go with an async server like Coro or POE,
and a NoSQL database.</p>

<p>I quickly realized that writing this system to be completely async was
going to be a nightmare that would take more than double the time. Part of
the problem was that while I was familiar with developing async
applications, I had only done it on a small scale in the past. The other
problem was that I kept running into modules I wanted to use that weren't
async compatible. Ultimately I ditched the idea of going async within the
first month.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I wasn't so quick to ditch the idea of NoSQL. I started with
MongoDB and CouchDB, but had trouble compiling them with the Perl bindings. I
planned on hosting on <a href="http://aws.amazon.com./">Amazon</a> at that
point, so I decided to give SimpleDB a go. The downside there was that there
were no decent Perl bindings for SimpleDB, that weren't entirely bare bones. So
with that I created <a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?SimpleDB::Class">SimpleDB::Class</a>
(based loosely on <a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?DBIx::Class">DBIx::Class</a>). The
module works great. Unfortunately SimpleDB doesn't. It's super slow. So four
months into development, with a whimper, I had to ditch my beloved <a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?SimpleDB::Class">SimpleDB::Class</a>

module. I'm glad I did. Development has been much faster and easier since then,
and a good amount of thanks goes to <a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?DBIx::Class">DBIx::Class</a> for
that.</p>

<p><a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?WWW::Facebook::API">WWW::Facebook::API</a>
has been largely abandoned by its author. He told me he doesn't have time to
maintain it anymore. And I was having a hard time getting it to work anyway. As
luck would have it Facebook just announced their Graph API, so I decided to
take on that project, and build a Perl wrapper around it. And <a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Facebook::Graph">Facebook::Graph</a>
was born. This enabled me to allow Facebook users to Single Sign On into the
web site, the game, and also interact with their accounts.</p>

<p>About the only other non-game piece that I had to invent of any consequence
was <a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?JSON::RPC::Dispatcher">JSON::RPC::Dispatcher</a>,
which is a Plack enabled web service generator. There are some other JSON-RPC
modules on CPAN, but for one reason or another I found them all completely
insufficient. Mostly because of one or more of four reasons:</p>

<ol>

    <li>It didn't support JSON-RPC 2.0.</li>

    <li>Its documentation was so poor that I couldn't make it work.</li>

    <li>It made me write a ton of code to simply expose a web service.</li>

    <li>It wasn't PSGI/Plack compatible.</li>

</ol>

<p>With <a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?JSON::RPC::Dispatcher">JSON::RPC::Dispatcher</a>,
I can expose object-oriented code as web services with a single line of
code.</p>

<p>I'm not very happy with the Perl modules that are out there for S3 right
now. Right now we're using a combination of <a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?SOAP::Amazon::S3">SOAP::Amazon::S3</a>,
and <a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Net::Amazon::S3">Net::Amazon::S3</a>,
and neither are particularly good, at least for our purposes. They both work,
but only for fairly basic purposes. Sometime in the near future I'll either
take on a massive overhaul of one of those modules, or write my own from
scratch. Which remains to be seen depending on how open the authors of those
modules are to patches.</p>

<p><strong>What did you need from SimpleDB besides more speed?</strong></p>

<p>What I was hoping I'd get out of SimpleDB was three things: massive
parallelism, hierarchical data structure storage, and schema-less storage
to make my upgrade path easier. It provided all of those things.</p>

<p>What I hadn't anticipated was all the limitations it would place on me.
Speed was just the nail in the coffin. It also puts pretty harsh limits on
the amount of data per record, the amount of data returned per result set,
and the complexity of queries. In addition, like most NoSQL databases it's
eventually consistent, which provides its own host of problems. I had
worked my way around pretty much all that, and then finally hit the
performance bottleneck.</p>

<p>At that point I knew I had to make a change, because I wouldn't be able
to make up the difference in parallelism. For example, in order to process
functions on a building, I would need planet data, and empire data in
addition to the building data. But I wouldn't know what empire or planet to
fetch until I fetched the building, which meant I'd have to do serial
processing. And I couldn't cache all the data for the empire and the planet
in the building (or vice versa) because of the limits on the amount of data
allowed to be stored per record. My two options were: 1) Bring everything
forward into memcached, which has its own problems because I'd have to
create an indexing system; 2) Move to a relational database.</p>

<p><strong>When did you start using <a
        href="http://plackperl.org/">Plack</a>?</strong></p>

<p>I first heard about Plack late last year when one of the contributors to
WebGUI did an initial test implementation (<a
    href="http://blog.patspam.com/2009/plebgui-webgui-meets-plack">PlebGUI</a>)
to see if we could use it in WebGUI. After seeing how cool it was I knew that
WebGUI 8 had to have it, and all my future projects would also use it.</p>

<p><strong>What's been the biggest benefit for you?</strong></p>

<p>The benefits are so huge that they are hard to enumerate, so I'll pick
the top 3 or 4. For the Lacuna Expanse, the main benefit was ease of
development. There were no longer any hoops to jump through (the mod_perl
landscape can be tricky to navigate). Sometime later Starman came out and
that gave me an instant boost to performance, which was also nice. For
WebGUI the middleware components were instrumental. They allowed us to
eliminate a lot of code we previously had to write ourselves rather than
using shared libraries. In addition, just switching from mod_perl 2 to
Starman (no other changes), gave us a 300% performance boost.</p>

<p><strong>You seem to be comfortable using a lot of new technologies with a
reasonable amount of traffic. How do you see the risks and the
rewards?</strong></p>

<p>First and foremost Miyagawa, who wrote Starman and much of Plack, is my
personal Perl hero. It seems like everything he writes is absolute gold. So
the fact that he wrote it adds some confidence.</p>

<p>But you're right, in general I'm not averse to using new technologies.
The problem with "tried and true" is that it's often "old and stale". So
from my perspective, there are just as many risks choosing proven
technologies as there are new ones. That doesn't mean you can blindly adopt
new technologies, but you should be on the lookout for them. The rest of
the risk/reward decision comes from my business experience: Change is
inevitable. If you try something and it doesn't work out, so what? Sure
it's going to cost you some time/money, but maintaining antiquated systems
costs a lot of money too. These days the pace of technology moves too
quickly to rest on tried and true alone.</p>

<p><strong>Are you comfortable with the risk that you'll run into maturity
problems and can patch them or work around them, or do you think that
despite their relative youth, they're very capable for your
purposes?</strong></p>

<p>Here's the thing. When you're running a technology based business, the
only thing you can plan for is that things will change.</p>

<p>Let's use scalability as an example. If you try to build a system that
will infinitely scale before you have any users then you'll spend a lot of
time and money on something that may never get any users. At the same time,
if you put no time into planning for some amount of scaling, then you won't
have enough breathing room to keep your users happy while you refactor.</p>

<p>Likewise you can't anticipate all the features you'll ever need, because
user's desires are hard to predict. And because of this, at some point
you'll likely make a fundamental flaw in your architecture that will
require at least a partial rewrite of your software. This is very much a
business decision. Most developers I know cry when I say that, because most
believe that it's both possible and desirable to reach
design/implementation nirvana. The fact is that users don't care if your
APIs are perfect. They care if your software does what they need it to do.
From a business perspective it's often more profitable to build something
quickly and then continually refactor or even rewrite it to match
demand.</p>

<p>I say all of this to make the point that if a particular new technology
doesn't work out like we expected it to, then we'll simply replace it in
the next iteration. If you go into the project with that mentality you'll
likely be more successful.</p>

<p><strong>What's the basic architecture of The Lacuna Expanse?</strong></p>

<p>The basic software architecture looks like:</p>

<a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/2010/10/22/arch.png" border="0"><img src="http://www.perl.com/pub/2010/10/22/arch_small.png" alt="basic architecture of The Lacuna Expanse" /></a>

<p>Basically per server configurable game rules go into various <a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Config::JSON">Config::JSON</a> config
files. <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?DBIx::Class">DBIx::Class</a> and
MySQL handle all of the game data storage and querying. Memcached sits off to
the side and handles lock contentions, limit contentions, session management,
and other server coordination communication. Unfortunately, not much can
actually be cached due to the dynamic nature of the game, unless I was willing
to cache basically everything, which I'm not. And all the static stuff, like
images, JavaScript, and CSS files get served up from CloudFront. We also push
our RSS feeds and other semi-static game content out to S3.</p>

<p>The game engine itself is basically an MVC setup built with Moose. <a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?DBIx::Class">DBIx::Class</a> and <a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Config::JSON">Config::JSON</a> act as
the model. Some custom Moose objects tied to <a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Memcached::libmemcached">Memcached::libmemcached</a>

act as the controller handling session management, privileges, etc. And <a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?JSON::RPC::Dispatcher">JSON::RPC::Dispatcher</a>
acts as the view.</p>

<p>The basic server architecture looks like this:</p>

<a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/2010/10/22/server.png" border="0"><img src="http://www.perl.com/pub/2010/10/22/server_small.png" alt="server architecture of The Lacuna Expanse" /></a>

<p>Any of the server nodes can be set up in either a clustered or load
balanced formation to handle traffic growth.</p>

<p>And finally we use <a href="http://github.com/">Github</a> as our
deployment system. We use its service hooks feature to trigger pushing new
content to S3/Cloudfront and code to the game servers.</p>

<p><strong>How many people are working on this?</strong></p>

<p>Six, plus a bunch of play testers. One artist named <a
href="http://ryanknope.com/">Ryan Knope</a>; plus a part time helper,
Keegan Runde, who is the son of one of the other developers. One on iPhone
development, named Kevin Runde. Two on Web Client development John Rozeske
and Graham Knop. Myself on server development. And myself and my business
partner Jamie Vrbsky on game mechanics development.</p>

<p>We started development in January 2010, and officially launched the game
on October 4, 2010. Now that we've launched, I've brought in one of my
other business partners, Tavis Parker, to help out with marketing the game.
And we're still pushing forward on new releases. We hope to have our first
expansion for the game, called "Enemy Within", out sometime in Q1 2011.</p>

<p><strong>How do you manage your development process?</strong></p>

<p>We're very loose on management.</p>

<p>We basically have a strategy meeting every 2 weeks at a local pub, where
we discuss whatever needs to be discussed in person. Beyond that we have a
play testers mailing list, a developers mailing list, and a defect tracking
system that we use internally. And other than that communicate through
Skype and email.</p>

<p>We manage all of our code and content through various public and private
github repositories. We share documents and art mockups using <a
href="http://dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>.</p>

<p>I publish all the JSON-RPC APIs out using POD (nicely formatted using <a
    href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Pod::Simple::HTML">Pod::Simple::HTML</a>)
to our play testers server, which is what the client guys develop against. And
then ultimately once vetted and implemented by our client guys, the APIs are
pushed out to the public server here at <a
    href="http://us1.lacunaexpanse.com/api/">http://us1.lacunaexpanse.com/api/</a>.</p>

<p>What little project management and coordination we need is handled by me
emailing back and forth.</p>

<p><strong>How often are your releases? What's the breakdown between bugfixes
and new development?</strong></p>

<p>For the Lacuna Expanse we're doing releases about 4 or 5 times a week. 1
or 2 of them contain some new features, and the rest are bug fixes.
However, TLE is very new. In the beginning it's very important to react
quickly to your users needs because they often find bugs you didn't, or
have feature ideas that are almost fundamental after you hear them, but you
never thought of them during the development process. By the end of the
year our development cycle will slow down quite a bit, probably to once per
week.</p>

<p>For WebGUI we release approximately once per week, and those releases
are primarily bug fixes. We generally do about 2 major releases per year
that are primarily new features.</p>

<p>For The Game Crafter we've stopped doing releases, except for the
occasional bug fix because we're coming into the holiday season. Starting
in January we're going to get going on a complete rewrite (about a six
month process), which will quadruple our feature set, give us about a 700%
performance gain, and allow us to scale with the growing demands our
customers are placing on us.</p>

<p><strong>Recruit existing Perl developers in your area, work with people
you've worked with before, or hire good people and train them?</strong></p>

<p>All of the above. When you're looking to hire someone you should hire
the best person you can afford to hire. In our case this means we've
decided to design our businesses around telecommuting. We still maintain a
small office, and still hire locally when we can, and we even provide
incentives for our employees to move to Madison if they so desire, but we
never throw out a resume based upon location, what schools they attended,
or whether or not they've happened to work with the particular modules and
technologies we're working with.</p>

<p><strong>I keep an eye on one of the alliances in the game populated by a lot
of well- known Perl developers, and they seem to be pushing the limits of
the public API. I know you made this API public for a reason (and increased
the call limit)--but do you foresee an endgame where the best client
automation wins, or do you expect that the game strategy will be malleable
such that clever players have an edge over automation?</strong></p>

<p>Automation has its advantages certainly. It's great for getting the
mundane crap out of the way.</p>

<p>Most games spend a lot of time and effort doing everything they can to
prevent people from automating their game. The trouble is that you end up
wasting a lot of effort trying to stop smart people from being smart. If
they really want to automate something they will find a way around your
restrictions. It's a never ending arms race.</p>

<p>In our case we decided to embrace these people. Better and better tools
will come along and ultimately that means these people are adding features
to our game that we didn't have to write. Because eventually the tools will
get simple enough that your average Joe can run them.</p>

<p>As far as the game is concerned it doesn't make a bit of difference that
you can use a tool to push a button in the game, rather than pushing the
button yourself. You still have to follow the same rules. It takes a
certain amount of time to happen, you have to spend a certain amount of
resources, etc. When it comes right down to it, someone still has to make
all of the important decisions, and that's not likely going to be a tool
anytime soon. You have to decide what buildings to upgrade in what order,
what ships to build, who to attack, how to defend, etc. And once the next
expansion comes out, you'll have to work with your team mates to build a
space station, enact laws, and defend your federation of planets. It will
be very much a social endeavor.</p>
