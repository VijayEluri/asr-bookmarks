<!-- begin content -->
<div class="node">
 <div class="content">
In 2001, Moshe Vardi organised a workshop devoted to a the topic of <a href="http://www.cs.rice.edu/~vardi/logic/" >The Unusual Effectiveness of Logic in Computer Science</a> with papers presented covering such topics as "Logic as the calculus of computer science" (Vardi) and "Descriptive complexity" (Immerman), and later a gang consisting of Halpern, Harper, Immerman, Kolaitis, Vardi, and Vianu published <a href="http://www.math.ucla.edu/~asl/bsl/0702/0702-003.ps" >a likewise named 24 page article</a> in the July 2002 issue of the Bulletin of Symbolic Logic.
<p>
The title is derived from Wigner's famous article on <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html" >The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences</a>, which was devoted to raising and attempting to answer the important question: why should mathematics have been so useful to natural scientists?  With respect to logic, my answer for the effectiveness of LICS is that, while computation is a physical phenomenon, it is a phenomenon that is best understood via powerful abstractions, and the most powerful abstractions we have at the moment are abstractions in mathematical logic, because of the fundamental relationship of Turing completeness to Goedelian incompleteness.

There was and is a large body of logic that was around before the Curry-Howard correspondence was really appreciated.

 <div class="content">I'm not surprised that the strategy of erasing details works, after all it's trivial that things will look more alike if you erase details. What I'm surprised by is that after erasing enough details to make algebraic topology look like logic you don't end up with a trivial theory. You still have a rich and complex theory and that theory is useful for working in other fields too.
<p>
A priori, logic and topology look quite different, and, in fact, objects and arrows in category theory and logic represent very different beasts. A sheaf in topology looks nothing like a sheaf in intuitionistic logic, and yet they are both sheaves and are both defined by the same non-trivial categorical definition. This is quite far from things looking similar because they've been smudged into each other a bit. This is a deep commonality between two highly complex structures.</div>

 <div class="content"><blockquote>What I'm surprised by is that after erasing enough details to make

<p>A <a href="http://www2.egr.uh.edu/~aagitten/quotes.html">quote</a> from <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polya">G. Polya</a> along the same lines:</p>

<blockquote>There are two kinds of generalizations. One is cheap and the other
is valuable. It is easy to generalize by diluting a little idea with a big
terminology. It is much more difficult to prepare a refined and condensed
extract from several good ingredients.</blockquote>

<p>I can't find the original quote at the moment.  I seem to vaguely remember
that Polya mentions group theory as an example of "valuable generalization" and
refrains from mentioning any specific examples of cheap generalization.
</p>


<p>Another quote on <a
href="http://www.marco-learningsystems.com/pages/kline/prof/profchap3.html">shallow
generalizations</a>:</p>

<blockquote><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl">Hermann Weyl</a>, one of
the foremost mathematicians of this century, expressed in 1951 his contempt for
pointless generalizations, asserting: "Our mathematics of the last few decades
has wallowed in generalities and formalizations." Another authority, George
Polya, in his <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/069102510X/">Mathematics and
Plausible Reasoning</a>, supported this condemnation with the remark that
shallow, cheap generalizations are more fashionable nowadays.  </blockquote>

<p ><i >I know when I am using intensional, extensional, or some informal -close to Leibnitz thingy- equality</i></p>
<p >To make these distinctions you need to have a pre-existing model that you are working with.  Typically, CT equality works across different models of equality, so it's more general.  </p>

To make these distinctions you need to have a pre-existing model that you are working with. Typically, CT equality works across different models of equality, so it's more general.

<p >Which makes it also very easy to make mistakes (think the usual mistakes in denotational semantics when confusing extensional and intensional properties of statements in PLs); but, ok, these errors are made apart from CT too so, well, you got a point there.</p>

<p >Yeah, actually, I think it was used as an opening statement in a speech on another topic once to stirr up the audience.<br >

 <h3 class="title"><a href="node/646#comment-5658" class="active">Exactly what did we gain?</a></h3>
 <div class="content">Understanding. If you use category theory in only one way there isn't much to gain. But every time you move to a new domain and don't have to learn new notation because you've used it already in another domain it makes life easier. I guess I'm also biased as I first met categories in a field where the payoff from using them was pretty large: topology.
<p>
If someone is using equality symbols without being able to explain what they mean then it isn't a problem with category theory, it's a problem with people not knowing what they are doing. This is common in many fields of study :-)</div>
