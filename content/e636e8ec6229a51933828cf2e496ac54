Exactly a year ago, I decided on a whim to make gingerbread cookies. I could do that back then; I had a little &#8220;baa&#8221;-ing baby trying to roll over in the living room and then he&#8217;d go no further! He&#8217;d be exactly where I left him! I mean, I still have a &#8220;baa&#8221;-ing baby but only if you prompt him with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/5285817669/">&#8220;And the sheep says?&#8221;</a> and he is never, ever where last I left him. I digress.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/5282829209/" title="mucho molasses"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5081/5282829209_cd539aaef2.jpg" width="500" height="332" alt="mucho molasses" /></a><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/5282826549/" title="so much spicy"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5046/5282826549_e866605a0a.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="so much spicy" /></a></p>
<p>You see, I have a flawlessly executed candlelit dinner every Christmas Eve with one of my closest friends from high school and her family. This tradition is 15 years on now and I enjoy it as much as my own people&#8217;s Christmas <i>Day</i> tradition of Chinese and a movie. Last year, she told me that her brother and his wife had wanted to decorate gingerbread men but realized they&#8217;d have no time to bake them. I saw my window, searched MarthaStewart.com for a recipe and got moving.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/5283432436/" title="making little men"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5085/5283432436_009a86d80a.jpg" width="500" height="332" alt="making little men" /></a></p>
<p><span id="more-7015"></span></p>
<p>Why Martha Stewart? Because I trust her implicitly on certain topics. I&#8217;m not particularly interested in how she makes steak au poivre, but when I want the lowdown decorating cookies, doweling a wedding cake, if I want some templates for crafty-awesomeness (she hasn&#8217;t yet requested my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/5113969469/">Jacob-Lantern</a> template or had me demo <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/5284002658/">my snowflakes</a> on her show, but I know she will any day now!) or a lead on making the kind of gingerbread that will make your German grandmother applaud because you finally got it right, I know Martha&#8217;s my lady.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/5283433596/" title="ready to bake"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5081/5283433596_3aaa6396fb.jpg" width="500" height="332" alt="ready to bake" /></a><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/5282839457/" title="all gift-ed up"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5008/5282839457_4cb8caaf1a.jpg" width="500" height="332" alt="all gift-ed up" /></a></p>
<p>And so I made her gingerbread and took a bite of it and it tasted, uh, <i>alarming</i>. I mean, not terrible but not the mild, middle-of-the-road gingerbread I&#8217;d expected from the patron saint of Nutley, New Jersey. I pulled up Twitter and asked &#8220;If I just made gingerbread so spicy my eyes watered a bit, does that mean I did it right or wrong?&#8221; and learned that Martha had actually helped me knock the ball out of the park. Apparently &#8212; and you&#8217;ve probably figured out by now how little &#8220;real&#8221; gingerbread I&#8217;ve experienced in my 34 years &#8212; this is the way it is done. A chewy, sturdy cookie that could be used for anything from a gingerbread house to gingerbread men to snowflakes. A spicy kick that lingers. A subtle sweetness that is harmonized by a sugary finish.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/5282842555/" title="tiny snowflakes"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5050/5282842555_d76761d17b.jpg" width="500" height="332" alt="tiny snowflakes" /></a></p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t mean to wait a year to tell you about these, but I figured that gingerbread was about as relevant the day <i>after</i> Christmas as heart-shaped boxes of candy are the day after Valentine&#8217;s. And so I blinked and a year passed and I would have completely forgotten about them had someone (hi, Sally!) not nudged me over email to post it. I&#8217;m glad she did. If you&#8217;re in a pinch and need a hostess gift or one last kid gift to take on the road with you, I can&#8217;t recommend a &#8220;kit&#8221; of these cookies with some shiny baubles for decorating enough. Or, you could just keep them for yourself, decorate them like snowflakes, serve them with a little eggnog and beckon the flurries to start already.</p>

<p><b>Spicy Gingerbread Cookies</b><br />
Barely adapted from <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/recipe/gingerbread-snowflakes?comments_page=3#conversation-container">Martha Stewart</a>, who knows a thing or two about gingerbread</p>
<p>This gingerbread is spicy and dark, chewy but sturdy and only a little sweet. If you&#8217;re used to more tepid gingerbread men, it will surprise you. If you always found gingerbread a little boring, it will delight you.</p>
<p>6 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for work surface<br />
1 teaspoon baking soda<br />
1/2 teaspoon baking powder<br />
4 teaspoons ground ginger<br />
4 teaspoons ground cinnamon<br />
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cloves<br />
1 teaspoon finely ground pepper<br />
1 1/2 teaspoons coarse salt<br />
1 cup (2 sticks or 1/2 pound) unsalted butter (at room temperature)<br />
1 cup packed dark-brown sugar<br />
2 large eggs<br />
1 cup unsulfured molasses</p>
<p><u>To decorate:</u><br />
<a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/recipe/marthas-royal-icing">Royal icing</a><br />
Various fine sanding sugars and sugar decorations</p>
<p>Whisk together flour, baking soda, baking powder, spices and salt in a large bowl and set aside. Beat butter and brown sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until fluffy. Mix in eggs and molasses. Add flour mixture, mixing on low until just combined. Divide dough into thirds and wrap each in plastic. Refrigerate until cold and firm, about one hour or up to two days.</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Roll out dough on a lightly floured work surface to a 1/4-inch thick. Cut into shapes of your choice, such as snowflakes* or gingerbread men. Spread two inches apart on baking sheets lined with parchment paper, and refrigerate until the cookies firm up again, about 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Bake cookies until crisp but not dark, 12 to 14 minutes. Let cool on sheets on wire racks.</p>
<p>When cool, you can decorate the cookies with icing and sprinkles. When you pipe designs, sprinkle the icing with sanding sugar and let it sit for five minutes before tapping off the excess sugar. Then let the icing set completely at room temperature, which will take an hour or so, depending on how thick it is.</p>
<p>Store cookies between layers of parchment or waxed paper in an airtight container for up to a week.</p>
<p>* By the way, I don&#8217;t recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001343WNO?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=smitten-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B001343WNO">my snowflake cookie cutter set</a> as you will grow gray hairs trying to get the cookie cutter back from the dough without pulling off some icicles. Look for a set with less intricate details.</p>

				<p>My grandmother just told me that all she wants for Christmas are home-made gingerbread man. How can I deny her that? This recipe looks like just the ticket! </p>
<p>And +1 to Martha Stewart being the go-to for baking recipes. She&#8217;s a guru!</p>

				<p>First comment? Wow! I think it&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve done this. </p>
<p>This is not about gingerbread. I&#8217;ve made several of your cookies, Deb (Hello Dolly bars, Russian Tea Cakes, Brown Butter Shorties, Almond Biscotti) and they&#8217;ve all been fabulous. This IS my GO-TO blog for anything I want to put in my mouth. And that sounded wrong.</p>
<p>Thanks for a wonderful blog, Deb!</p>

				<p>This has been my go to gingerbread recipe for years. I use it for Easter, Valentine&#8217;s Day, Christmas, you name it. My nephew is a HUGE fan of it and requests them often. </p>
<p>The beauty of the recipe: the longer you keep them, the better they taste!</p>

				<p>I made the dough for these last night (Martha&#8217;s original version) and baked them today.  I just made them into rounds so they&#8217;d fit into my gift boxes that I&#8217;m giving away at work (you remember how well nurses love cookies).  I am flooding the tops then piping snow flakes and other winter themes on them.  Your snow flakes are gorgeous, btw.</p>

				<p>Do you think I could use it to make the &#8220;cookie&#8221; part of a whoopie pie? Regardless, I&#8217;ll be making some of these with my little boy, maybe on Christmas Day :) Thank you!</p>

				<p>Deb:  I love your recipes and cooking advice, but I am so effin sick of hearing about your offspring.  It&#8217;s rad that you have a baby, but that&#8217;s not why we come to your website.  Can you write a post w.o including something about your baby?  How is the baby germane to this post?</p>

				<p>Deb, do you have an opinion on whether this recipe would work for gingerbread house construction?  I&#8217;ve heard there should be extra flour in the dough to make it stiff enough to build a house, but 6 cups already seems like quite a lot.  Thanks!</p>

				<p>okay, i&#8217;m about to blow your mind, not that I like to toot my own horn or anything.  I use MS&#8217;s recipe every year for gingerbread.  This year I used treacle instead of molasses (I live in Europe and molasses is hard to come by) and whoa.  Total flavor enhancer.  TOTAL.  It makes the cookie so much richer.  I didn&#8217;t even use the black pepper because I was out.  Treacle is amazing.  You have not tasted gingerbread cookies until you have used treacle.  Give it a try next year and see what you think.  I thought it would just be a simple substitution.  Wrong.  Adds a wonderful flavor.  Merry Christmas. xo</p>

				<p>These look absolutely lovely&#8211;I&#8217;m definitely going to try them for our Christmas Eve movie watching night!</p>
<p>Just a note: In the one year ago/two years ago/etc. section before the recipe, you&#8217;ve reversed the categories. Dutch babies were four years ago, not one, and how to host a brunch was one year ago, not four.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve found MS recipes are very hit or miss and have even found great discrepancies between the book and online versions of the same item! Tsk tsk but I do agree I still go there for a lot of ideas and have yet to totally give up on her.<br />
Your idea for gifting premade cookies to decorate is very cute and I have to say I love snowflakes with the cut out centers &#8211; is that a specific all in one cutter or did you use two? Any links for where to get what you used?</p>

				<p>@Darryl. I&#8217;ll try to be polite here. Speak for yourself. Many of us love hearing about Deb&#8217;s son and will never tire of hearing about him. And would enjoy seeing pictures of him in each and every recipe post.</p>
<p>Deb, i was just knocking around your site looking for a frosted raisin bar cookie that i&#8217;m pretty sure i saw on the net, and must have seen on one of my favorite sites&#8230;of which this is one! So far i haven&#8217;t found those bar cookies but you just posted these gingerbread men and i&#8217;ll be more than happy to be satisfied with them instead. Thanks!</p>

				<p>Looks like these were worth the year-long wait, Deb! I make soft ginger cookies of my own, but they are of the round and soft variety, circular and homey rather than delicate and lovely like yours! Your description makes me want to whip up a batch of these.</p>

				<p>To poster #11:  what a shame you can&#8217;t enjoy Deb&#8217;s mom-ness as well as her skill as a cook.  I don&#8217;t have kids and yet the first thing I do when looking at a post is search for the link to the photo of her drop dead gorgeous little boy.  If you don&#8217;t want to hear about a blogger&#8217;s personal life (sorry but isn&#8217;t that what a blog is intended to provide?) then just scroll down to the recipe.</p>

				<p>Darryl, I am sorry that you do not appreciate Deb&#8217;s conversations about her son.  While I am sure you are correct and their are others who agree with you I believe their are far more who enjoy this peek into her life.  I agree with Mel, if you dislike these mentions, scroll down to the recipe.  Just know you will be missing the character of this site.</p>

				<p>I have never made gingerbread-boy/girl cookies before.  My poor children must feel deprived!  I guess I&#8217;d just had too many icky ones that were tough and hard in my youth and didn&#8217;t think them worthy of the bother.  I&#8217;ll make these now, since you&#8217;ve done all the leg work!  Thanks, Deb!<br />
.<br />
ps..made the 7-layer cookies for the 2nd year in a row..they are so stinkin good!  Still my favorites!</p>

				<p>Deb, I just made gingerbread cookies last night!  I checked your website since I couldnt find any recipes, i settled for one on allrecipes.  I cant wait to try yours, I had a really hard time when I rolled out the recipe I made, I had to do it between two sheets of parchment paper because they were so sticky.  Also I love seeing the baby pictures in every post, so PLEASE dont stop including them.</p>

				<p>Kirsten &#8212; I think it would be perfect for gingerbread house construction.</p>
<p>Darryl &#8212; I think it&#8217;s important to keep in mind that this site is not really a reflection of the prejudices of individual readers. I don&#8217;t avoid meat because many readers are vegetarian (though I do delete &#8220;eweee, I wouldn&#8217;t eat that!&#8221; comments). I don&#8217;t skip sharing process photos because someone else once complained the site is too &#8220;photo heavy&#8221;. Four years ago I talked about being a newlywed too much, three years ago I grumbled about not liking my cubicle job too much, now you&#8217;re stuck hearing about the kid. Or not stuck. Really, nobody makes you read anything you don&#8217;t want to read.</p>

				<p>Bravo, Deb.</p>
<p>Equipment question: you aren&#8217;t, by chance, familiar with the Wonder-Cup?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wonder-Cup-Two-Adjustable-Measuring/dp/B000I21N7O" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Wonder-Cup-Two-Adjustable-Measuring/dp/B000I21N7O</a></p>
<p>I have a similar tool, and I love it.  I don&#8217;t use it often (once or twice a month?), and I dislike gadgets, but I make exception for this thing for measuring all sorts of syrups and thick dairy products like yogurt and sour cream.  Just wondered if you were familiar and/or bothered by scraping sticky things from dry measuring cups.  If you are and you&#8217;re not, then never mind.  :-)</p>
<p>p.s. &#8220;eweee, I wouldn&#8217;t eat that!&#8221; comments are the height of lameness, in my opinion.  It kills me that anyone would waste their time to express such thoughts in any way.</p>

				<p>Seeing this oh-so-lovely and ever-so-German gingerbread recipe reminds me of another favorite: Lebkuchen.  I&#8217;ve made several batches in the past few weeks and have had a blast.  Epicurious has Gourmet&#8217;s recipe, which is about as close to the real thing as you can get without letting the dough proof for WEEKS (which is part of the  authentic Nürnberger lebkuchen/pfefferkuchen).  Here&#8217;s the link: <a href="http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Lebkuchen-107446" rel="nofollow">http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Lebkuchen-107446</a></p>

				<p>I also felt the urge to make gingerbread for the first time this year, probably because of my own wee offspring (and, btw, keep mentioning yours; it *is* relevant to how you&#8217;re cooking, I think). I adapted a recipe from Gourmet, in which you cook the molasses, sugar and spices on the stove first; interesting and very easy. Like yours, they also came out really dark and freakishly spicy, but that&#8217;s because I doubled the spices. </p>
<p>Happy Holidays!</p>

				<p>Wow, your cookies look beautiful!  I have avoided making cookies this year with the oven busily baking other goodies and friends sharing their sweet works.  I may just have to cram these in though.  I&#8217;m a big fan of gingerbread, but haven&#8217;t made cookies.  Thank you for the inspiration!</p>

				<p>Okay, I have to know how you made the snowflakes in the windows.  They are absolutely fantastic.  Also, where did you get the snowflake cookie cutters?  Lastly, although I have actually made some of your recipes, I read this blog for the pictures of Jacob.  Your recipes are good also; I like them because they are easy and taste fantastic, but I google this site almost daily to see if there are any new pictures of the kid.  Thanks for sharing.</p>

				<p>I love your blog just the way it is! I think you are much more judicious than I would be if I had a cutie like Jacob around. I cannot fully express how much I enjoy all the bebes shared on blogs&#8211;they brighten my grandchild-less days.</p>
<p>Oh&#8211;I love the recipes, too!</p>

				<p>Hummm, love the look of these cookies.  Personally, I am a fan of the soft kind of gingerbread, you know the kind that looks like a brownie but is actually gingerbread.  So I may have to try these.  I enjoy your site immensely, every aspect of it.  This includes the recipes (of course), the photos and the tidbits about your life.  It makes it seem like a really good friend is letting me in on just a small part of their life.  Your dry sense of humor and the quality of writing is what distinguishes your site from those others.  Keep up the good work.</p>

				<p>Deb,</p>
<p>Thanks for the gingerbread recipe, but i&#8217;m posting more because i noticed that 4 years ago you blogged about the spinach and cheese strata.  that strata has become my go-to for every brunch i have hosted in the last 2 years (since i discovered your site).  it is so popular with my friends/family that it will be a main part of the brunch buffet at my wedding.</p>
<p>so thanks for being awesome and helping me impress my friends and family</p>

				<p>I am so glad I delayed my gingerbread men making.  I had searched your site earlier this week looking for a recipe and was so happy to click on your page today to see them!!  Something about the pictures and your prose that gets me fully in the baking spirit! :)</p>

				<p>Looks delicious!  I wanted to point out that I think your &#8220;four years ago&#8221;, etc. recipes are reversed in order&#8211;not that it matters very much :) I only noticed it after just searching for the brunch post&#8230;</p>

				<p>I just have to add my 2 cents&#8230;.I first read through and look to where I can find the link to Jacobs picture (he really is the most perfect looking Angel) and then I read through again to look at the actual recipe. I always debate whether its the people that make the food good or is it just the food itself that makes a good experience&#8230;in your case, its the whole package that makes your blog sooooooo wonderful. Have a terrific Holiday Season.</p>

				<p>Deb, your personalilty, sense of humour and unique advice is why I read this site- and the fact that you post the most delicious recipes and everyone thinks I am a great cook all because of you. I love reading about your family and seeing photos of the increasingly-cute Jacob. Personalisation is highly &#8216;germane&#8217; to blogging- if I just wanted recipes I&#8217;d read a cookbook or go to a commercial site. It&#8217;s too bad that not everyone appreciates the amazing opportunity the net affords us to interact with people we would otherwise never had found- as Alix said your posts makes me feel like I am getting a little window into the life of a friend. As you pointed out yourself, no one is being forced to read the site or the entire post. Keep up the good work and have a lovely holiday and new Year.</p>

				<p>It&#8217;s obviously that time of year&#8230;I just posted my gingerbread cookie making today, too. I used Dorie Greenspan&#8217;s recipe for &#8220;Spice Roll-Out Cookies,&#8221; and they&#8217;re awfully good, though not as dark as these. Maybe next year I&#8217;ll make these and compare the two! Love the comment about substituting treacle&#8230;reminds me of a Laurie Colwin gingerbread (the cake kind) recipe that calls for Lyle&#8217;s Golden Syrup. It puts gingerbread with molasses to shame.</p>

				<p>I&#8217;m starting to get a little obsessed with gingerbread.  My &#8216;go to&#8217; recipe which has been used for Christmas tree decorations, party bags and for countless baking sessions with my children (you will be investing in little rolling pins soon &#8211; I guarantee it!) is gooey too but sweeter than this recipe &#8211; soft light brown sugar and golden syrup rather than the deep dark molasses.  But I&#8217;m drawn to this darkness &#8211; a more adult gingerbread would definitely appreal to my tastebuds and your pic seems to show that it keeps its shape very well.  I love the contrast of the white icing with the sombre biscuit.  Our Dubai food bloggers group had a gingerbread decorating session at my house recently and we&#8217;ve decided to make it an annual thing too &#8211; so light and dark gingerbread for next year seems a good idea.  Have a lovely Christmas &#8211; it&#8217;s so special when you&#8217;ve got a little one.  Really enjoyed reading and cooking from your blog this year.</p>

				<p>Man, too bad you didn&#8217;t post this a couple weeks ago, as I made another gingerbread cookie recipe from Martha&#8217;s site and it was kinda lame&#8230; way too bready, not very sweet and frankly not very enjoyable. I&#8217;ll have to try these eventually. Sounds like they&#8217;re a bit more like a gingersnap, which is in reality what I want it to taste like! Also the cookies are so pretty! Thanks for sharing it with us.</p>

				<p>This recipe is arriving just in time! I&#8217;ve been wanting to make a serious standout gingerbread cookie, and this looks like it fits the bill. By the way Deb, I love hearing about your life. I come back for the great recipes, but weaving in who Deb is makes this blog real and enjoyable. Merry Christmas!</p>

				<p>If you&#8217;re ever in the market for a milder gingerbread (but with a great consistency), check out Rose Levy Berenbaum&#8217;s recipe from her Christmas Cookies book&#8211;<br />
it&#8217;s been my go-to for years (although the dark color in this one is gorgeous. Maybe a change in store for next year!)</p>
<p>Also, Martha&#8217;s gingerbread white-chocolate blondies are the greatest ever.</p>

				<p>Gah, and of course I made gingerbread cookies yesterday. Those will probably be bland enough for the family but man I wish I&#8217;d made these instead as I love my gingerbread with some kick. Well there is no such thing as too many gingerbread cookies right? Right. Maybe a half recipe&#8230;</p>

				<p>I have been reading Smitten Kitchen for years now.  I have enjoyed the morph from newlywed&#8230;to cubicle drone&#8230;to freelance&#8230;to mom. My (now)nine year old daughter and I love reading your website together and cooking from it.  She LOVES the Jacob search and thinks that he is almost as cute as her one year old baby brother.  </p>
<p>We are anxiously awaiting the book!</p>

				<p>My favorite gingerbread is a moravian gingerbread cookie. It&#8217;s the one I&#8217;ve had since I was a little girl helping my mom in the kitchen. It&#8217;s strongly spiced and crunchy but then melt in your mouth. When I think gingerbread they are what I&#8217;m thinking. One of those recipes. I hesitantly put them up on my blog this past week <a href="http://dabblingsandwhimsey.blogspot.com/2010/12/way-cookie-crumbles.html" rel="nofollow">http://dabblingsandwhimsey.blogspot.com/2010/12/way-cookie-crumbles.html</a> So many of my friends and family enjoy my posts I felt obligated even though this is one of those family recipes I am very protective over. Nothing scents a house like a good gingerbread cookie!</p>

				<p>OMG! i literally just finished the dough for these an hour ago, to make cookies tomorrow (i got it from martha&#8217;s website a few days ago) and i look on your website and here it is! so exciting. i&#8217;m glad to hear my cookies will probably be delicious tomorrow.</p>
<p>i&#8217;m going to use star and bird cookie cutters, skip the royal icing, and use currants and raisins to decorate instead.</p>

				<p>Sorry Deb but i believe Swedish gingerbreads are the best.  They are called pepparkakor and yes you can get them in Ikea and most stores, also knows as gingerbread snaps.  For me they are the only ones i will make and eat.  But yours do look adorable!  God Jul to you!</p>

				<p>first of all &#8211; Darryl, perhaps we are so &#8220;effin&#8221; sick of people who have nothing better to do than complain. Last I checked, reading this (wonderful) blog was voluntary. Take your unhappy a$$ over to a child free site. I am quite positive none of us will miss you.<br />
Second &#8211; do not change a single thing about this site deb. Your writing, the recipes AND the photos all add up to fantastic. And even if it didn&#8217;t &#8211; its your site, do what YOU want.</p>

				<p>I totally don&#8217;t get the complaint about seeing photos of your incredibly adorable son.  I have to admit that I look for those before going back to read the recipes.  He couldn&#8217;t be cuter and your photography is great.  PLEASE don&#8217;t stop posting photos of him!  Besides, you very subtly mention him and readers have to click on the links to see the photos.  You&#8217;re not forcing anyone to look at him.  (Can&#8217;t imagine not wanting to, though&#8230;) What an unnecessary, ratty comment!  BTW, your recipes are great and the snowflake cookies are gorgeous!</p>

				<p>I wish I&#8217;d read this before making my gingerbread house today! It looks so much spicier, I hate how most recipes give just a teensy little gingery taste. Oh well.<br />
I guess I may just have to try it again :P</p>
<p>Speaking as someone who doesn&#8217;t like children &#8211; I love, absolutely LOVE hearing about yours. Don&#8217;t stop. I came here for the food years ago, and I stayed because of the stories, and the love, and the laughter, and the various anecdotes.<br />
Your kid is cute, and we&#8217;re lucky that you share both the recipes and your life with us. </p>

				<p>Great stuff! Love the colour too. A day too late this year, but never mind, will keep for next Dec. Oh how I&#8217;ve searched and experimented for a &#8220;knock-ya-socks-off&#8221; gingerbread recipe.<br />
I have a 7 month old who has just learnt to crawl, your writing made me laugh. The royal icing was a challenge yesterday with a kazillion bub interuptions as he attempted to get into anything that was dirty, dangerous or delicate. Thanks Deb and Merry Christmas to you and your not so little one.</p>

				<p>These cookies look amazing. I&#8217;d love to see what other recipes you&#8217;ve photographed that didn&#8217;t make it to the blog in time, these pictures are wonderful! This might be a silly question but does the butter need to be room temperature? I&#8217;d like to bring these to dinner tomorrow. Thanks, Deb!</p>

				<p>Just yesterday I was searching online for a recipe for &#8220;spicy gingerbread cookies.&#8221;  I&#8217;m living in the Netherlands, far from my cookbooks and suddenly realized I had to have real gingerbread cookies.  I looked here first, and when I didn&#8217;t find anything I ended up finding the Martha recipe&#8230; and now you&#8217;ve posted this and I am absolutely positive I have to make them today.  Of course there might be a few substitutions since some American ingredients are hard to come by.  Thanks and happy holidays!</p>

<p>Wishing you your families Merry Christmas and Happy New Year, and wishing that the new year brings lots of happiness, good health, prosperity and good eating:) All the<br />

				<p>This sounds like just the ticket, Miss Deb! Emerging from Maryian Death Flu up here in Westchester, and thinking some baking is in order, since I (for once) got the gifts wrapped early.<br />

				<p>So, as I couldn&#8217;t find molasses or golden syrup here in the Netherlands, I&#8217;m thinking I&#8217;ll do this with honey. I managed to royally mess up a previous gingerbread recipe, so I&#8217;m hoping this one will be kinder to me.</p>
<p>Any ideas on the honey?</p>

				<p>I feel the same way about Martha.  She is my go to when I need an idea for something crafty, or something that needs to be &#8216;perfect&#8217;.  (Smitten Kitchen is also my go to when I need a fantastic recipe to show off to friends!)</p>
<p>Martha&#8217;s gingerbread recipe is one of my favourites, I tried it out last year too and kept it to make again this year!  </p>
<p>Thanks for sharing!</p>

				<p>As a mom of three, I really appreciate that you include tidbits about your life as the mother of a busy toddler who still takes the time to cook good, fresh food rather than resorting to prepackaged &#8220;convenience&#8221; foods.  Every time I am tempted to take the easy way, I look to your blog for inspiration.  Our babies are only about a month apart in age, and it really helps me to know there is another mom who has not given up on her passion for cooking and who does not compromise regarding what she feeds her family.  Thanks, Deb.  You are the best!  Happy holidays.</p>

				<p>totally digging the dark gingerbread cookies like justeen said above.  nice tip on not killing yourself over the dough caught in cookie cutter routine.<br />
the 1 cup of unsuflured mollasses will make it potent.  i might be obliged to cut that back some.  i think it is the odor more than the flavor that gets me.<br />
have a happy and safe holiday everbody</p>

				<p>Just made these cookies, they came out beautifully, but one little problem&#8230;they taste very salty :(. I used coarse mediterranean sea salt&#8230;wondering if it&#8217;s different than &#8220;coarse salt&#8221;, which is called for in this recipe. Anyone know? Thanks.</p>

It&#8217;s your blog, and you write about things you know and love. And we all love your recipes, sense of humour, and more than anything, that delightful little Jacob. Happy holidays and keep those pictures coming!</p>

				<p>Beautiful gingerbread Deb!  My go to recipe is the thick and chewy gingerbread from Cook&#8217;s Illustrated.  I posted about them recently. (<a href="http://saltandserenity.com/2010/12/10/day-four-gingerbread-snowflakes/" rel="nofollow">http://saltandserenity.com/2010/12/10/day-four-gingerbread-snowflakes/</a> )  I will have to give Martha&#8217;s a try.</p>

				<p>I made this recipe from Martha to make fantastic Gingerbread houses! (I didn&#8217;t need to add extra flour because you work so much in when you flour your surface) I just suggest chilling the dough properly so that your house shapes keep the right form, and then trimming the edges when they&#8217;re warm our of the over so the icing adheres better. I one-and-a-half-ed the recipe and got 4 gingerbread houses and enough leftover dough to make 98 gingerbread cookies! </p>
<p>As a side note, I MUST comment on #11 &#8211; My sister and I are avid readers of SK, and she emailed me late last night saying &#8220;GO LOOK AT SMITTEN! It&#8217;s UNBELIEVABLE what someone would say about our Deb!&#8221; and I did and she was right. Your personal touches make me see you as a distant friend I don&#8217;t get to see all the time, but care a lot about. Please don&#8217;t change anything about your site&#8230;it&#8217;s what makes me so gleeful when I pull my (now famous) peanut butter cookies out of the oven and proudly exclaim &#8220;They&#8217;re Deb&#8217;s recipe!&#8221;. Happy Holidays to you and yours!</p>

				<p>Those cookies look amazing.  Maybe if you grease the cutters they won&#8217;t stick as much? I haven&#8217;t actually tried this myself, but it seems a shame that such lovely cutters would go to waste.</p>

				<p>Giovani &#8212; Good catch. It should be softened a bit. I&#8217;ll edit that in.</p>
<p>Re, substituting honey for molasses &#8212; I&#8217;ve often done this in cakes but I haven&#8217;t tried it here. It <i>seems</i> like it would work but I can&#8217;t green light it without hearing that someone was successful in doing so. So, if you try it with a whole or partial honey swap, please report back. I am sure there are others either unable to get molasses or a little freaked out by its intensity.</p>

				<p>Lady, you&#8217;re killing me. I just made a double-batch of the roasted chestnut cookies (which turned out wonderful, btw) and am no longer in baking capacity. These do look so very pretty though, and I love a spicy cookie too. *Sighs* Next week then, I suppose. Also, please do keep us posted about your little man. I must say I look forward to viewing his picture in every post as much as (or even slight more than) the recipe itself. Thanks for a wonderful site!</p>

				<p>Sorry but you are a couple of days late, made and finally finished our gingerbread yesterday.  I found my German teacher&#8217;s  recipe hidden in something over the summer..still just as good as it was all those years ago.  Will try this one as my son likes a chewier cookie as opposed to crunchy. And he&#8217;d go for the spicier version too.  I like the darker look too, just like gingerbread cake, honey will make it lighter or less intense than the molasses.  Love the snowflakes, cutters and always the pictures of Jacob and also your website.</p>

				<p>I wouldn&#8217;t want Deb to change a thing about Smitten Kitchen, but I would also add that sometimes the focus on Jacob is frustrating&#8211;not so much what Deb has to share that&#8217;s useful and interesting as it is part of her life an the context in which she cooks&#8211;but the kazillion coos in the comment section. It&#8217;s already frustrating that many people comment without having made the recipe or with tips from their own experience, and sometimes scrolling through additional &#8220;he&#8217;s adorable&#8221; posts are irritating. I appreciate that Darryl spoke up for himself (could it have been done in a nicer way?) although he probably also spoke for a number of folks who would never share such a thought publicly. It&#8217;s just a comment, just feedback, and Deb is right to say that there will always be something that some one might comment negatively on and that will change as the site continues to grow and evolve.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m definitely able to still come and read the site&#8211;even the baby food satellite site&#8211;and use what I can and appreciate the community here. It&#8217;s a testimony to the quality &amp; strength of the site that some of are &#8220;outside&#8221; the baby love but still show up every day. But yes, sometimes it feels as if the comments reflect what I also find frustrating in real life. At least it&#8217;s easier to ski[ over it on the web. : )</p>

				<p>Hi Deb,<br />
     First of all I have to admit that I have been lurking around here for over a year and have decided to &#8220;unlurk&#8221; just to tell you how much I love your site in general. I am in full agreement with Wendy (#75)! It really bothers me that someone would post something like that (#11) when no one is forcing them to read here. I could spend hours looking at your blog trying to &#8220;plan&#8221; for dinner then I am out of time and have to make something out of my usual recipes, lol. Although I have tried several of your recipes and they always turn out great! I always look here first for a recipe for something, hoping you have some version or another of it.<br />
     These cookies look outstanding. I have never been a huge fan of gingerbread but these are intriguing. I might just have to try them!<br />
     @Daryl, if you don&#8217;t like it, leave. There are plenty of other food blogs out there, and we love Deb and Jacob just the way they are! No one is making you read this blog!</p>

				<p>Wow, Darryl, Grinch much?  I have tons of work friends who talk non-stop about their kids and it drives me nuts (this from a person having trouble getting pregnant).  I don&#8217;t feel that way about this site.  I love hearing about Jacob and Deb&#8217;s family life.  That&#8217;s what food is about.  Family, friends, kids, love.  Why eat wonderful food if you don&#8217;t have that?  Buy a Hungry Man and call it a day.  Don&#8217;t come in here and attack Deb.  Find a different blog to read.</p>

				<p>hi. i love martha too! i have been making gingerbread cookies every christmas since my boys were little&#8230;and i always use martha&#8217;s recipe from her circa 1980 christmas book called &#8220;melissa&#8217;s gingerbread cookies&#8221;.  i haven&#8217;t ever seen another recipe like it.  you cook the sugar, molasses and spices on the stove first and then mix it together with butter and flour with the mixer once the bubbly hot ginger goo has cooled a little.  truly the best.  and the dough rolls out perfectly everytime.  not sure why she isn&#8217;t publishing this recipe anymore? but you might want to try it for a variation sometime. btw,  love the pictures of jacob!</p>

				<p>About the snowflake cookie cutters&#8211;have you tried both keeping them in the freezer until you are ready to start cutting cookies? I also find dipping the cookie cutters in flour between each and every cookie helps with sticking. I don&#8217;t hesitate to wash the cutter, dry it, and re-dip into flour if something sticks. Lastly, with very sticky dough I roll out onto floured foil or parchment&#8211; I find that cutting foil or parchment seems to help the cookie cutter release from the dough a bit more. And sometimes I just cut out all the cookies and pick-up the excess dough instead&#8211;putting the parchment right on a cookie sheet and into the oven.</p>

				<p>The problem with my snowflake cutter is that there&#8217;s not ENOUGH detail, and after they bake, the snowflakes look more like flowers.  In fact, I made a batch of gingerbread &#8220;flowers&#8221; last weekend!</p>

				<p>When I looged on last night after weeks of heavy distractions at my job, I browsed all the &#8220;missed posts&#8221; to see what&#8217;s up with Jacob and loved the standing up video! Now begins that time of serious transition from baby to boy as the upright and mobile position changes everything.<br />
This morning, I came back to see what&#8217;s cooking in the Smitten Kitchen.<br />
Thanks for reminding me about the slice &amp; bake cookie rolls. I&#8217;d love to spend the day rolling, cutting and baking gingerbread but with shopping to be done, I think s&amp;b are more attainable.</p>

				<p>I have always used the Joy of Cooking recipe, or the Better Homes and Garden recipe &#8211; mild, sweet and addictive but now that I know what I&#8217;ve been MISSING I&#8217;m going to give these a try.  I&#8217;m with you on the snowflake cutters &#8211; I tossed mine last year!  Pain in the arse!  Have a merry holiday and I agree with the comment left above, Smitten Kitchen is my &#8220;go-to&#8221; when I want the definitive answer.  And PLEASE post a tutorial on your snowflakes &#8211; what fun that would be to show my grandson!!</p>

				<p>i made this exact recipe from martha stewart, but my gingerbread does not look nearly as dark as your gingerbread.  mine are very light brown.  how did you get your gingerbread dough to get so dark?</p>

				<p>As per usual, I need to ask you if you think substituting nutmeg for the cinnamon would work in this particular recipe. It&#8217;s too late for me to make this year, but I&#8217;d love to try it next year. If you could let me know, I&#8217;d be grateful!</p>

				<p>Thanks again, Deb! Making these now.</p>
<p>To the people doubting the intensity of the spices or molasses, the more icing and decorations are added, the sweeter the cookie will taste once finished. Something to keep in mind. Good luck to everyone trying to crank these out before tomorrow!</p>

				<p>Dear Darryl:  Please allow me to respectfully disagree with you.  Personally, I adore seeing pictures of the world&#8217;s (well, after my son when he was a baby) cutest, huggable, precious baby with the most astonishing head of hair.  So there!</p>
<p>I agree with another commenter &#8212; while some of Martha&#8217;s recipes are the best &#8212; I&#8217;ve had problems with others.  Plus, I then see the exact (incorrect) recipe repeated in her magazine, a book, the web.  (If I had any hair left I be pulling it out.)  And some of her recipes are too strongly flavored for my tastes.  Think Lime Melt-Aways.  Deb, I know your acid loving hubby loved them but I gagged. Yes, this is easily remedied by cutting back.  Like with this recipe.  If I try them I&#8217;ll start with far less ginger.</p>
<p>Wishing everyone Peace, Love and Joy . . . and may all your Christmas and Chanukah dreams come true.</p>

				<p>Oh my&#8230;I LOVE gingerbread that makes my eyes water a bit from the spice.  These sound simply perfect, and I could admire the photos all day. Thanks for sharing your culinary exploits as well as your lovely little boy with this group of strangers.  It&#8217;s very generous of you.</p>

				<p>This is the first time I&#8217;ve made gingerbread.  I just came here to get the recipe for the green tea shortbread sandwiches when I saw this post.  I happened to have everything I needed to make them and they looked so Christmas-y.  They came out perfect.  Thank you for remembering to share this. </p>
<p>I have the same star cookie cutter and my problem isn&#8217;t with getting all the details out of the cutter, its with getting the cookies off the counter top and still look decent.  I suppose I&#8217;m not flouring my work surface enough. </p>
<p>When I made the shortbreads, I didn&#8217;t have any matcha so I used extra powdered sugar and just made plain cookies.  I rolled out o my scraps from that and the gingerbread and rolled them up to make pretty little swirl cookies.</p>

				<p>Thank you for saving the world from boring, dry, and as you put it, tepid, gingerbread!  I can&#8217;t wait to make these tonight; it&#8217;ll be the perfect Christmas Eve activity.</p>
<p>I love Michelle&#8217;s (#64) comment &#8211; I am fully Team Jacob as well!!</p>
<p>I also loved Michele (#16) suggestion of eating these with lemon yogurt&#8230; that sounds absolutely DIVINE.</p>

				<p>Okay, these cookies are amazing. Mine turned out nowhere near as dark as yours, but I think it&#8217;s because I used a mild molasses and had to substitute a teensy bit of white sugar for the dark brown I was lacking (was not about to go to the store on Christmas Eve of all days). Thank you for the recipe!</p>

				<p>Made today, and they were amazing! Best gingerbread cookies I&#8217;ve ever had. Mine spread a bit more than yours did. The shapes remained, but not as crisp as yours.  Any ideas why? I chilled the dough before and after shaping.</p>

				<p>Have been using the MS recipe for some time&#8230; made 3 tiny little gingerbread houses this year (and the recipe works well for even big houses, even in humid alabama, and they stay upright for weeks, and even taste good after that). However, yours just look more indulgent and dark than mine. Every time you do it!</p>
<p>And I too, in case you wanted my two cents, love hearing about your baby. Because lets be frank, if we lived alone in this world, our cooking would be much different (for me, microwaved frozen brussel sprouts) than the act of love that we fuss and worry over for our families and friends.</p>

				<p>Huh&#8230;I literally just pulled these out of the oven, let them cool, took a bite and all I really thought was &#8220;&#8230;meh?&#8221; I followed the recipe to a T, and I was expecting a whallop&#8211;or at least a knock on the chin? But these just seem so bland! Can&#8217;t figure out what I might have done wrong?? I was short about 1/2 a teaspoon pepper, so perhaps that could account for it? In any case, the photos are beautiful, and I&#8217;m still gonna decorate the hell out of them and feed them to people tomorrow before dinner. Definitely edible, just not what I was expecting :n /</p>

				<p>Ok ok these are actually growing on me. I think maybe I was just expecting something different. Also it&#8217;s really not fair for me to claim I followed the recipe  and then be all like &#8220;oh yeah I was short so and so.&#8221; I guess I just had a hard time believing something so small would throw off such a big batch, with those 6 cups of flour and all. Anyways, now I feel like a grinch! Sorry!</p>

				<p>Perfect timing! I couldn&#8217;t decide which of many recipes to make and there yours was. If SK and MS say it&#8217;s so, then it must be true. Strangely, I have no fine ground black pepper, but I have a ton of white. The cookies turned out great and now I&#8217;ll turn the nieces and nephews loose for decorating. Thanks!</p>

The cookies look gorgeous, I tried gingersnaps for the first time just recently, and had the same reaction! Went and asked mom whether they are supposed to be so spicy. Apparently, they were perfect, and I loved them after a few :)</p>

				<p>Aaand I take it back, again. These somehow got worse overnight. Now they&#8217;re near rock hard and have a really unpleasant aftertaste. Who knows, maybe it&#8217;s the recipe, maybe I screwed up, but I definitely wont be risking it again. Ok, that&#8217;s my two cents, I&#8217;m done!</p>

				<p>I made them in the shape of Eiffel Towers for a not-xmas birthday dinner tonight. I added a dollop of dark rum with the molasses, &#8217;cause booze is so lovely in many sweets. I loved the raw dough, but the big test will be after dinner tonight when the birthday boy munches on his gingerbread Paris monument!</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve never made gingerbread before, but this year I was seriously bitten by the gingerbread bug.  I&#8217;ve been looking up recipes feverishly but wasn&#8217;t satisfied until now!  These look amazing!</p>
<p>P.S.  I also get to use my brand new kitchen mixer and sassy red mixing bowl set for the first time.  Woohoo!  (But I expect my boyfriend had ulterior motives for giving me new kitchen &#8220;toys&#8221; apart from just making me happy. :-) )</p>

				<p>I decided last minute to make your gingerbread recipe for a party and they were a big hit. I can&#8217;t stop eating them myself! Yours are so much darker than mine, and I am wondering if you used an extra dark molasses or brown sugar?</p>

				<p>I made these, but definitely didn&#8217;t get the spicy overload. Apparently these become very-interesting-but-still-normal gingerbread if your parents&#8217; spice rack is on the old side. I can&#8217;t wait to try making them at home with freshly ground spices and get the 4-alarm kick, since I love me some spicy food.</p>
<p>And in response to #11, I don&#8217;t have kids/don&#8217;t want kids/kids make me kind of nervous, but I absolutely LOVE reading about Jacob. He is, objectively, the cutest darn thing on earth, and the photos are to die for.</p>

				<p>I made these cookies this weekend to great success, I&#8217;d like to give my two cents if it will help those who had some troubles with the dough.  When making cut-out cookies, or any cookie that keeps it&#8217;s shape once baked, remember to chill the dough thoroughly before baking. The longer the better, an hour will do or half the time in the freezer. Then move them straight from refrigerator to oven and bake away. Parchment reduces spread, as does a non-greased baking sheet. Silicon may encourage spread if oils aren&#8217;t washed away properly. Hope that helps! (By the way, I&#8217;ve learned most of this stuff from Deb, so you can thank her once again! :)</p>

				<p>I made gingerbread from a Martha Stewart Living magazine recipe years ago and I&#8217;ve been searching for it ever since. The gingerbread had a tablespoon or so of bacon grease in the recipe. It gave the gingerbread the most wonderful hint of smokiness that went perfectly with the ginger. If anyone still has that bacony gingerbread recipe, I&#8217;d sure love to have it. Also, find a spectacular lemon curd (like Trader Joe&#8217;s) and dip your gingerbread cookies! Yum!</p>

				<p>Awesome recipe!  Amusing comments.  #11 is an example of why we have security screening in airports, tamper proof bottles, and security passwords.  One bad apple&#8230;&#8230;FYI, my cookies were cute mules with long ears and frosted mane and tails.  They brayed with flavor!!</p>

				<p>Hey Deb! As a student new to baking, I&#8217;m wondering about your placement of the dry ingredients in your photo above. I usually heap all of mine in the bottom of the bowl as the recipe lists them. Do you arrange yours in neat side-by-side heaps for the photographic aspect of it (which I always love!) or for the purpose of better mixing?</p>

				<p>Great post, love the baby talk, there&#8217;s room for us all. As a potter, I find that if I cover a slab of clay with saran wrap, then cut my shapes out just pressing the cutter on the plastic-covered clay, it can&#8217;t stick and gives a nice rounded edge. Peel up the saran wrap and with a sharp knife do any needed further cutting to free the cookie. My motto is that the more we use our baking knowledge in clay, the better; sometimes it works the other way, and what goes for clay also helps for dough.</p>

				<p>We made these! We had just seen the program on Martha Stewart&#8217;s kitchen (i think that it was a re-run) and then I found the recipe on your blog! (You rock Deb). We also made your mother&#8217;s cookies (wonderful) and a sugar cookie star tree that reminds me of why you have the amazing blog, and not I.<br />
Happy New Year! Peace and blessings!</p>

				<p>Well, your flurries have arrived. Although they quickly moved up the ranks to blizzard. I thought staying in and baking would be nice, and this recipe would have been amazing. Unfortunately my in-laws don&#8217;t cook much, let alone bake anything from scratch. I went through your archives and found a cream cheese pound cake that I had all the ingredients for. I&#8217;ll make these when I get home (whenever the airports open back up) even days and days after Christmas.</p>

				<p>I have to be honest, I&#8217;ve been disappointed in every Martha Stewart baking recipe I&#8217;ve tried.<br />
On the other hand, Smitten Kitchen recipes are huge successes. (my friends still rave about your car bomb cupcakes!!)<br />
I&#8217;ll have to give this recipe a try since it&#8217;s been Deb tested. ;)</p>

				<p>These cookies were executed with flawless detail and tons of love (my brother still talks about them).  If the dinner was flawless, it was because of those who ate it.  As always, my dearest, the company of you and Alex makes the holiday bright.  Cheers to all of your success.  Wishing you nothing but continued success in the New Year.

				<p>Emily &#8212; The dry ingredients you see were the spices. I like to premeasure my ingredients; it keeps me sane because my cooking process gets broken up so much by a baby underfoot. Measuring ingredients one at a time, I know once they are all laid out the actual assembling of the dish is really quick.</p>
<p>Shari &#8212; Spread usually has more to do with the recipe, and occasionally, <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/tips/why-did-my-cookies-spread/" rel="nofollow">technique</a>. This one is very sturdy.</p>
<p>Giovani &#8212; Excellent advice. FWIW, however, parchment paper is coated with silicone.</p>

				<p>I made these and used corn syrup instead of molasses (Europe &#8230;) &#8211; they were lovely, kept their shape perfectly. A lot paler than yours though. I might try next with honey, as I think it&#8217;d give more flavour than the corn syrup.</p>

				<p>I used this recipe to make a gingerbread Space Needle and it worked great.  It also works well to take a walnut-sized chunk of dough, roll it into a ball, flatten it into mixture of coarse sugar and sea salt, and bake it that way instead of rolling and cutting.</p>

				<p>[#107] Yes, some of us comment without having first made the recipe or have any tips to add. I believe Deb&#8217;s blog is mature enough to have different classes of readers who reacts in their own way, positively or negatively. Not all readers can immediately start working on a recipe but would like to thank Deb for inspiring them, this is also why SK is so successful. </p>
<p>I spend enough time scrolling through recipes with 200+ comments to look for recipe related feedbacks with no issues.</p>
