        <h2>Welcome to Tiny Core Linux</h2>
        
        <p>Tiny Core Linux is a very small (10 MB) minimal Linux GUI Desktop. It is based on Linux 2.6 kernel, Busybox, Tiny X, and Fltk. The core runs entirely in ram and boots very quickly. Also offered is Micro Core a 6 MB image that is the console based engine of Tiny Core. CLI versions of Tiny Core's program allows the same functionality of Tiny Core's extensions only starting with a console based system.</p><p>

It is not a complete desktop nor is all hardware completely supported. It represents only the core needed to boot into a very minimal X desktop typically with wired internet access.</p><p>

The user has complete control over which applications and/or additional hardware to have supported, be it for a desktop, a netbook, an appliance, or server, selectable by the user by installing additional applications from online repositories, or easily compiling most anything you desire using tools provided.</p>

<p>The latest version: <b>3.3</b></p>

<h2>News</h2>
<div id="news">
<h3>v3.3</h3>
<p>
Tiny Core now supports data centric view by way of the new integrated GUI file manager with 
associations and a GUI editor. Also new is much finer control of launcher icons and launcher placement. 
Many other improvements throughout the system while still staying miniscule at 10.6MB.
</p>
</div>
<div id="news">
<h3>v3.2</h3>
<p>
Updated busybox, adding mouse "select for copy" to several GUIs,  better
internationalization suport, and improved Onboot and OnDemand handling, make up
this 3.2 release.
</p>
</div>
<div id="news">
<h3>v3.1</h3>
<p>
The major theme for this release is the introduction of on demand icons. This allows
for more options to have even faster boot times with the easy access to less often
used application extensions. Much improved internationalization support and many other
upgrades and enhancements performed through out the system.
</p>
</div>
<div id="news">
<h3>v3.0</h3>
<p>
All new kernel, modules, libraries, and support for unlimited loops make up the new
Tiny Core / Micro Core 3.0. Freedesktop support and many improvements to Apps Audit
and OnDemand features. Also support for RAID disks and new bootcode to blacklist modules.
</p>
</div>
<div id="news">
<h3>v2.11.6</h3>
<p>
The major theme for this release is the adoption of the freedesktop.org standard.
Our implementation provides better support of modern desktop environments while still
supporting legacy window managers. Also new is Universal OnDemand for both DEs and 
legacy WMs. Thus providing users with more options for even faster booting and efficient
use of memory.
</p>
</div>
<div id="news">
<h3>v2.10</h3>
<p>Recursive processing of dependencies now fully supported. 
Custom software upgrades to appbrowser, no popups, GUI redesign.
Default window manager now has a more traditional iconize button.
Improvements to ondemand, appsaudit, and cpanel. New default background
color, and improved logo.
</p>
</div>
<div id="news">
<h3>v2.9</h3>
<p>Many system updates, including udev, libstdc++ now supports exceptions,
glibc now supports a wider array of processors, and virtual environments. 
</p>

<p>Custom software upgrades to appbrowser, "What Provides" and,
appsaudit, "Display All not depends on". Wbar background relics bug fixed.
Improvements to "easy mode remastering", improved language support by auto loading
locale files when present.
</p>
</div>
<div id="news">
<h3>v2.8.1</h3>
<p>New for this release is having a single directory for extensions and 
dependencies. This greatly improves systems resources by having a single 
copy of dependencies.</p>

<p>The loading of extensions is now controlled by a simple text file 
named 
'onboot.lst'. Enter only those apps that you wish to have loaded upon 
boot. Do not enter dependencies as they will load when needed from 
optional. Appbrowser's Install will automatically add to onboot.lst. 
Appsaudit provides an easy to use GUI to setup and maintain 
onboot.lst.</p>
</div>
<div id="news">
<h3>v2.7</h3>
<p>Tiny Core and Micro Core were made easier to use by standardizing on 
a 
single extension installation method (mount) while still supporting 
'copy into filesystem'. 
Updated versions of appbrowser and appsaudit fully support this major 
new feature.</p>

<p>In TC/MC prior to v2.7, (2.0 - 2.6.1), a support extension, 
tce-notify, 
will be required. It should be loaded first, as only extensions loaded 
after it can benefit from its handling. This is a stopgap measure; 
upgrading to v2.7 is strongly recommended. tce-notify is a daemon which 
runs both ldconfig and depmod for every extension, so using it will put 
additional load on the system compared to the previous behavior.</p>

<h2>About Our Project</h2>

<p>Our goal is the creation of a nomadic ultra small desktop capable of booting from cdrom, pendrive, or frugally from a hard drive. The desktop boots extremely fast and is able to support additional applications and hardware of the users choice. While Tiny Core always resides in ram, additional applications extensions can either reside in ram, mounted from a persistent storage device, or installed into a persistent storage device.</p>

<p>We invite interested users and developers to explore Tiny Core. Within our forums we have an open developement model. We encourage shared knowledge. We promote community involvement and community built application extensions. Anyone can contribute to our project by packaging their favorite application or hardware support to run in Tiny Core. The Tiny Core Linux Team currently consists of eight members who peruse the forums to assist from answering questions to helping package new extensions.

Learn. Share. Grow your knowledge of Linux.
