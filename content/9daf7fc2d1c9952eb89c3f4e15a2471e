<h1>librsync</h1>

<p>librsync is a free software library that implements the
<a href="http://rsync.samba.org/tech_report/">rsync remote-delta
algorithm</a>.  This algorithm allows efficient remote updates of a
file, without requiring the old and new versions to both be present
at the sending end.  The library uses a "streaming" design similar to
that of <tt>zlib</tt> with the aim of allowing it to be embedded into
many different applications.

<p>librsync is currently pre-1.0, with most important functionality
working.

<p>librsync is not wire-compatible with rsync 2.x, and is not likely to
be in the future.

<p>This is a new codebase, designed to allow a fresh start on the
problem and a cleaner design.  It may be used in a future version of
rsync or a successor project.  Early steps towards that are visible
in Wayne's <a href="http://opencoder.net/new-protocol.html">rZync</a>
prototype, and Martin's
<a href="http://samba.org/~mbp/superlifter/">superlifter</a> design.

<p> The librsync project was created by <a href="http://sourcefrog.net/mbp/">Martin Pool</a>
and is now being enhanced and finished by the folks you can find on the
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/librsync">project page</a>.

<p> The librsync algorithm is based on the well-known and trustworthy rsync
software by Andrew Tridgell.
