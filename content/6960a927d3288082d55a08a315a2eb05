<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>FlashQard is an educational software to improve your learning process.
It is designed to help you learn not only a new language but anything that can be learnt!
<br>This aim is achieved by using the widely used method, called Leitner System, and the idea of "different card types for different purposes".
<br>Leitner System (proposed by Sebastian Leitner in the 1970s) is one the most efficient methods for learning.
Which allows you to focus on the most difficult flashcards and not waste your time on what you have already learnt.
</p>
<p align="center" style="color: #0A00B1; font-weight: bold;">FlashQard is developed to combine the immense power of computers and the power of Leitner System.</P>

		it supports MDic databases. But also, it uses "Google translate" service which is able to translate
		more than 50 languages. Not only words, but even sentences!<br>
		Furthermore, there is a button above each translation which says "create a card". As you can guess,
		it simply creates a card based on the search phrase and the translation.<br>

		<dd>On 22 July 2009, FlashQard 0.13.0 was released with a lot of changes.<br>
		Finally, the text editor was completely replaced (by QtWebKit) and made us free to add a lot of cool features that was not possible using the last text editor. Though, qt 4.5.x should be installed in order to use the software<br>
		For now, the visible changes are consistent card appearance. in other words, appearance of all cards can be changed at once. Also, a basic image editor is added which is able to resize, rotate, flip and mirror images.<br>
		Moreover, an "Export" dialog has been added with lots of options for those cool people who like to <b>share</b> their knowledge with others :)<br>

		<dt>SVN Repository</dt>

		<dt>FlashQard is Back with Version 0.12.0</dt>
		<dd>After a few months, on 28 June 2009, a new version of FlashQard is released
		with a nice set of features and a few bugfixes.<br>
		The most notable features include a new section to maintain
		cards known as "stack". Cards inside the stack are not
		included in review sessions. It is very useful when you import
		a file of hundreds or thousands of cards.<br>
		Now, multiple cards can be dragged and dropped between stages
		and/or stack. You can also set navigation settings in review
		sessions. Therefore you can review random cards or marked
		cards or any card.<br>
		At the last but not the least, text-to-speech is now supported
		in windows version!<br>
		See <a href="changeLog.php">Change Log</a> for full details.
