<h1>What Is The Ruby Programming Language?</h1><br>

<p>The Ruby Programming Language was the brainchild of Japanese computer whizz Matz Matsumoto and emerged onto the world in the middle of the 90's. Since then it's pretty much taken the world by storm, thanks largely to Ruby on Rails, a web application network which was completely written in Ruby and became extremely popular in 2005. The two go kind of hand in hand with many people not even realizing that there is a different between the Ruby language and Ruby on Rails. The Ruby Programming language was originally influenced by Smalltalk, Perl, Lisp and Eiffel. The language was designed to be more powerful than Perl, but also more object-oriented than the language Python.</p>

<h2>Reasons Behind The Ruby Programming Language</h2>

<p>The Ruby Programming Language differs from other computer languages in one very important way. Matsumoto explains his philosophy behind his program:</p>

<p>"Often people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines. They think, "By doing this, the machine will run faster. By doing this, the machine will run more effectively. By doing this, the machine will something something something." They are focusing on machines. But in fact we need to focus on humans, on how humans care about doing programming or operating the application of the machines. We are the masters. They are the slaves."
The Ruby Programming Language was designed to minimize confusion, even for the most experienced users, and its popularity is largely credited with the ease in which it can be learned (well, lots of people find it easy anyway). Matsumoto designed a language which he would enjoy using and it's incredible popularity has proven that lots of other people enjoy using it too.</p>
