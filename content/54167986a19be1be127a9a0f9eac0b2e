<h2>Outcomes Measurement:
A Primer for Orthotic and

<p>
<i>All science is measurement.</i><br />

		-Helmholtz (1)

<h3>
		ABSTRACT</h3><p>
<i>
		Outcomes measurement has become the
		essential component of any continuous
		quality improvement process. Increasingly, consumers and payers of healthcare services demand objective data,
		based on outcomes, to evaluate the quality of care among their providers.</i></p>
<p>
<i>This article presents a basic overview
		of outcomes measurement and its potential application to orthotic and prosthetic practices. It suggests a systematic approach to continuous improvement,
		with outcomes measurement as the principal focus. It also identifies potential areas of O&amp;P care and management that
		could be monitored, with objective data
		and evaluation, to establish demonstrable outcomes of quality care.
		</i></p>
<h3>
		Historical Overview</h3><p>

		Fundamental to any component of patient care is measurement of performance; i.e., performance not only in the
		context of what and how care is delivered, but by the outcome of such care
		as well.
		</p>
<p>

			Until recently, the prevailing quality
		paradigm incorporated the beliefs that
		health-care organizations were collections of unrelated units; that higher
		quality meant higher costs; that quality
		was defined as meeting minimum requirements; and that the mechanism of
		evaluation ignored variations in care.
		</p>
<p>

			In this paradigm, organizational 
		leadership was fueled by individual results. Unfortunately, the paradigm
		caused internal conflicts within organizations by creating competition for resources based upon individuals' perceived contributions to quality. Organizations were hierarchical and incorporated short-term thinking and objectives. This thinking resulted in an inward focus on quality improvement.
		</p>
<p>

			In essence, the health-care organization viewed itself as the customer. It
		failed to recognize the need to meet external expectations of the real customers-patients and payers.
		</p>
<p>

			The current environment, however,
		has witnessed an increased public demand for accountability in health care.
		Simply stated, patients, payers and others have begun to realize cost is not the
		sole determinant of quality. Rather, the
		ultimate outcome of care, based on the
		processes of care delivery, is the important factor in determining the quality of
		care. Thus, cost and quality have been
		linked in the minds of consumers and
		has become known as cost effectiveness.
		</p>
<p>

			The new paradigm stresses the importance of an organization as an integrated system of units that have a mutual and collaborative impact on quality. It demands the organization understands variation in the delivery of care.
		It also understands that an emphasis on
		quality creates a chain reaction that
		leads to lower costs.
		</p>
<p>

			Within this context, organizational
		leadership becomes obsessed with
		quality within every component of the
		organization. It stresses unity of purpose; it evaluates and finds fault with
		the system of care rather than penalizing the performance of individuals. It
		ultimately creates a sense of teamwork
		rather than competition among individuals. As a result, the organization develops an "outward focus"-the staff, patients and community become the customers.
		</p>
<p>

			W. Edwards Deming, a leading statistical quality control expert who is
		viewed by Japanese industrialists as the
		"founding father" of quality improvement, identified the "quality chain reaction" (see <a href="JavaScript:popup('popup.asp?xmlpage=1995_04_132&amp;type=image&amp;id=f1','400','550');">Figure 1</a>
) that serves as the
		visual personification of this paradigm.
		The model legitimizes the need for organizations to pursue performance improvement in that it directly affects the
		tangible goals of increased market
		share and organizational sustainability.
		</p>
<p>

			Yet one of the greatest challenges
		that faces health-care organizations, including those engaged in orthotics and
		prosthetics, is successfully evolving
		from the old to the new paradigm. Organizations must learn to apply concepts and methods of performance
		measurement that use outcomes as the
		driving concern for evaluating and improving clinical or administrative functions and procedures. The difficulty involved in this process is illustrated by
		the various methods of quality improvement that range from the most
		basic to the most sophisticated approaches:
		</p>
<ul><li><i>Chart audit</i>: an early attempt to
		define quality by reviewing individual
		patient records to determine if the care
		for specific patients was appropriate
		and effective (achieved maximum quality).
		<p>

			Unfortunately, this process rarely
		identified patterns or trends of care
		across a population of patients.
		</p>
</li><li><i>Medical/care audits</i>: evaluations
		that were devoted largely to a specific
		condition or treatment, the results of
		which may have led to changes in treatment or delivery of care to achieve perceived quality.
		<br />
<br />

			This method, while more advanced
		than simple chart audits, often was
		based on perceived problems; there
		were no investigations as to whether
		problems actually existed. For the most
		part, this resulted in the expenditure of
		significant resources with little evidence of "pay-off."
		</li><li><i>Time-limited, focused studies</i>: evaluations of a treatment protocol used
		across a patient population over a specified period of time. Until recently, this
		methodology was the predominant
		quality improvement mechanism. The
		focus of assessment was on those functional activities or care processes that
		affected overall quality.
		<br />
<br />

			This methodology paid moderate attention to outcomes. However, little data were used to determine if those outcomes were appropriate to the population. In addition, corrective actions typically were imposed on the human side
		of the equation; human error was cited
		as the cause of diminished quality. Given that such evaluations were time-limited, the methodology frequently failed
		to continuously monitor corrective actions to determine if improvements
		were made or sustained.
		</li><li><i>Continuous improvement</i>: as promulgated by health-care standards
		adopted by such groups as the Joint
		Commission on Accreditation of
		Healthcare Organizations, organizations have adopted performance improvement initiatives that identify important aspects of care; establish indicators of optimal performance; apply
		thresholds of acceptability; implement
		actions to improve performance; and
		conduct follow-up oversight to determine if improvement has been
		achieved.
		<br />
<br />

			As initially administered, many organizations tended to use this approach
		as a more sophisticated evaluation of
		processes. Again, emphasis on outcomes typically was limited due to the
		perceived lack of valid data that established optimal patient/condition outcomes with various processes.
		</li><li>Outcomes measurement: rather
		than emphasizing a particular evaluation approach, outcomes measurement
		uses the best features of the aforementioned methods: (1) acquiring patient/care data through chart review;
		(2) identifying optimal treatment/management paradigms affecting patient
		outcomes through periodic audits; (3)
		verifying results through focused studies; and (4) establishing monitoring
		techniques, indicators of performance
		and thresholds of acceptability as embraced by continuous improvement
		techniques.
		<br />
<br />

			Most importantly, outcomes measurement stresses the value of evaluating treatment and management paradigms on the basis of optimal outcomes
		by using treatment protocols or management processes that are efficient, efficacious and appropriate. This approach also drives an organization to
		understand variation in care across patient populations. Thus, it embraces
		both the desire to assure optimal quality for a specific patient but also encourages improvement in processes that
		benefit all patients.
		</li></ul><h3>
		Controlling Variation to Achieve Optimal
		Outcome</h3><p>

		The focus of any performance improvement program that stresses achievement of optimal outcomes requires efforts to identify and control variation in
		the processes of care. Deming identifies
		two types of variation:
		</p>
<ul><li><i>Common causes</i>. These are the
		variations in a process common to
		every occurrence of that process. These
		causes behave in different ways at different times and produce a variation in
		process outcomes that exhibits no particular pattern but is predictable within
		definable limits. All processes have
		common cause variation.
		<br />
<br />

			Processes in which only common
		cause variation is present are said to be
		"in statistical control." For example, the
		use of certain components in orthoses
		or prostheses cause varying stress tolerances depending on the materials used.
		<br />
<br />

			In designing and fabricating devices
		that will produce optimal outcome-
		restoring or improving function-it is
		important to monitor the stress performance of such components. Should the
		components fail to meet either maximum or minimum tolerances, the
		process of fabrication or materials used
		for the components should be changed
		or modified.
		
		</li><li><i>Special causes</i>. These are the variations that affect a small group of occurrences and usually are abrupt at onset.
		Sometimes referred to as "sentinel
		events," these special causes can come
		and go sporadically, or they can cause
		sustained shifts over longer periods of
		time before changing once again.
		<br />
<br />

			Processes that contain special causes
		of variation are said to be "out of statistical control." Using the previous example, a sentinel event would be the
		complete failure of a component that
		could result in patient injury or destruction of the orthosis or prosthesis.
		<br />
<br />

			The outcomes-based performance
		improvement process monitors both
		types of causes through statistical evaluations. <a href="JavaScript:popup('popup.asp?xmlpage=1995_04_132&amp;type=image&amp;id=f2','400','550');">Figure 2</a>
 portrays both types of
		variation. Using time and frequency as
		the axes, a specific process can be monitored. By averaging the frequency of
		events plus or minus x standard deviations, upper and lower control limits (or
		maximum and minimum tolerances)
		are established.
		<br />
<br />

			The intent of the monitoring function is to identify those points along a
		process continuum in which both common and special cause variations can
		regularly be observed. In this way, actions can be taken to both eliminate future sentinel events and minimize common variations, thus elevating the efficiency of the process and achieving optimal outcome.
		<br />
<br />

			This approach establishes a surveillance system that prevents adverse outcomes instead of a system that devotes
		resources to correcting adverse events
		after they occur.
		</li></ul><h3>
		Units of Measure</h3><p>

		The initial steps in performance improvement are establishing units of
		measure and identifying (statistically)
		optimal outcomes for the processes to
		be measured. As with many segments
		of the health-care industry, the availability of outcomes data is generally
		quite limited. For the most part, little
		data have been published other than
		traditional morbidity and mortality statistics for medical/surgical settings.
		</p>
<p>

			A similar paucity of outcomes data
		exists for the care of orthotic and prosthetic patients. However, possible
		sources for acquiring population-based
		orthotic and prosthetic outcomes data
		can include manufacturers' data, academic research, scientific studies or peer
		data from similar practices.
		</p>
<p>

			In the absence of published data, the
		practice may need to establish baseline
		outcomes data by "benchmarking" performance of specific processes, patient
		outcomes or devices. In so doing, outcomes goals are initially established
		based on available information. As data are generated and evaluated, the
		outcomes goals are refined to reflect
		that experience.
		</p>
<p>

			In initiating outcomes goals, indicators of performance should be identified for which statistical outcomes are
		established. <a href="JavaScript:popup('popup.asp?xmlpage=1995_04_132&amp;type=image&amp;id=t1','400','550');">Table 1</a>
 sets forth possible
		indicators for use in O&amp;P care. They
		span both administrative and clinical
		outcomes.
		</p>
<p>

			Regardless of the indicator used, outcomes measurement demands the use
		of data and rates of occurrences to determine if a process is functioning efficiently and achieving the desired outcome. Two essential types of data
		should be acquired: rate-based and sentinel-event data.
		</p>
<p>

			A rate-based indicator measures, by
		proportion or ratio, the occurrence of a
		particular event as compared to the
		universe of events (for example, initial
		appointments within x time from referral versus all new patient appointments). Should a process goal or outcome not be achieved, the organization's obligation is to initiate systems
		changes that will eliminate the deficits
		causing the unacceptable rate.
		</p>
<p>

			A sentinel-event indicator identifies
		an event or phenomenon that always
		will generate further analysis and immediate corrective action. In general,
		sentinel events are viewed as immediate threats to improved quality and
		should elicit an intensive evaluation to
		prevent similar occurrences in the future (see <a href="JavaScript:popup('popup.asp?xmlpage=1995_04_132&amp;type=image&amp;id=f3','400','550');">Figure 3</a>
).
		</p>
<p>

			In establishing such process or outcomes thresholds, it should be noted
		that under a perfect set of conditions,
		the goal always should be 100-percent
		achievement of an outcome and 0-percent recurrence of a problem.
		</p>
<p>

			However, in health care, including
		O&amp;P, events beyond the control of the
		practice frequently will prevent
		achievement of "zero defects." Thus, it
		is important to understand that setting
		thresholds of acceptability (rate-based
		or sentinel) will likely need to reflect
		those uncontrollable events (for example, patient noncompliance with the
		proper use of the orthosis or prosthesis). While 100-percent achievement
		may not be realistic, the spirit of continuous improvement dictates that
		thresholds should continue, over time,
		to be elevated, thus ever improving the
		identified process and outcome.
		</p>
<h3>
		Performance Improvement Tools</h3><p>

		An organization may implement a variety of administrative methods to pursue performance improvements. A consistent theme evident in successful programs is the methods must embrace
		logical evaluative techniques and use
		methodical instruments for understanding complex processes and data.
		</p>
<p>

			The two most frequently used approaches are illustrated in <a href="JavaScript:popup('popup.asp?xmlpage=1995_04_132&amp;type=image&amp;id=f4','400','550');">Figure 4</a>
.
		FOCUS and PDCA techniques encourage a systematic strategy for carefully analyzing and continuously monitoring and improving processes of care.
		But most importantly, the selection of
		processes must be guided by the objective of improving outcomes associated
		with the processes. Therefore, these
		methodologies stress the use of evaluation tools, including the use of flowcharting (see <a href="JavaScript:popup('popup.asp?xmlpage=1995_04_132&amp;type=image&amp;id=f5','400','550');">Figure 5a</a>
) and fishbone
		diagramming (see <a href="JavaScript:popup('popup.asp?xmlpage=1995_04_132&amp;type=image&amp;id=f5','400','550');">Figure 5b</a>
). These instruments facilitate the isolation of key
		functional activities of a process that influences outcomes. They help direct
		performance improvement activities on
		discrete components of the process that
		will most directly influence quality. In
		other words, they facilitate the analysis
		of cause and effects, support the capturing of objective data, and document
		the process under evaluation.
		</p>
<h3>
		Conclusion</h3><p>

		Several important conclusions are evident in outcomes-based performance
		measurement mechanisms:
		</p>
<ol><li> The evaluation of a specific
		process and its associated functions
		must produce measurable outcomes.
		Merely evaluating and modifying a
		process without the objective of linking
		such refinements to a measurable outcome renders the continuous improvement model ineffective.
		</li><li>	Outcomes-based performance
		measurement programs require the rigorous use of statistical tools and the acquisition and use of objective data to
		reach conclusions. They also demand
		continuous monitoring to evaluate the
		effectiveness of changes made to the
		process based on documented changes
		in outcomes.
		</li><li> A continuous quality improvement strategy demands the commitment of all people associated with the
		organization, including its administrators and clinicians. The organization
		must be viewed as a cohesive system of
		processes, which, in interacting with
		one another, ultimately affect outcome.
		</li><li> Finally, as orthotics and prosthetics
		organizations begin to implement continuous improvement programs, results
		of these efforts must be used to objectively demonstrate improved patient-care quality. In so doing, facilities will
		enhance their abilities to attract patients and strengthen reimbursement
		relationships.
