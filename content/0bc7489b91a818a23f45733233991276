Supermon is a high-speed cluster monitoring system that emphasizes
<a href="LowPerturbation.html"><b>LowPerturbation</b></a>,
high <a href="SamplingRates.html"><b>SamplingRates</b></a>,
and an extensible <a href="DataProtocol.html"><b>DataProtocol</b></a>
and <a href="ProgrammingInterface.html"><b>ProgrammingInterface</b></a>.
It has been shown to scale from the most basic
single processor machines to large scale, 1024 (2048) processor
clusters.
Although it is most frequently used on Linux-based clusters, the
infrastructure
is in no way limited to this operating system provided that data can be
extracted from the operating system and presented in the correct
format.

of
compiling performance results and comparisons with other monitoring
systems
to help users choose which monitoring system best fits their needs.

<div style="text-align: left;"><font size="-1">Supermon
is a exible set of tools for high speed, scalable cluster
monitoring. Node behavior can be monitored much faster than with other
commonly used methods (e.g., rstatd). In addition, Supermon uses a data
protocol based on symbolic expressions (S-expressions) at all levels of
Supermon, from individual nodes to entire clusters. This contributes to
Supermon's scalability and allows it to function in a heterogeneous
environment.</font><font size="-2"><br>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Mon
and Supermon</h2>
<h4><p><font size="-2"><font size="-1">Two
small server programs move
data from the kernel to clients, and
provide that data via TCP at both single and multiple node levels. At a
single node, a kernel module provides data in its two /proc entries
(see above). The <em>mon</em> server acts as a filter
between /proc
and the TCP clients: It parses the s-expressions found in /proc, adds a
minimal amount of information, and passes that data to clients on
demand. For each client that connects to it, mon maintains a bitmask
reflecting the data fields that particular client requests in a sample.
That way, mon filters data and reduces wasteful network traffic. A
second server - <em>Supermon</em> - lets clients see a
snapshot of a <em>set of nodes</em>
in each sample. Supermon connects to nodes that run mon servers, and
concentrates their data. It then presents the data sampled from many
mon servers in a single data sample. The data format provided to
clients by Supermon is identical to mon's data format. That allows many
Supermon servers to be created, each sampling from a subset of the
nodes within a cluster. New Supermon servers could then be started to
connect to the Supermon servers already monitoring portions of the
cluster.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hierarchical Supermon servers improve performance in situations
where a cluster has many nodes and sampling rates are high. Supermon
provides a bitmask-based filter for each client (similar to mon), which
is then used to improve efficiency between the Supermon/mon and
Supermon/client connections.</font>
