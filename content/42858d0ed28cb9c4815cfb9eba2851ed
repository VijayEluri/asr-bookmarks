<h1>Introduction to Statistical Thought</h1>

<B>Introduction to Statistical Thought</B> grew out of my teaching
graduate and undergraduate statistics courses
for many years, and from my experience as a statistical consultant and
collaborator.  I wanted to write a text that
<ul>
<li>explains how statisticians think about data,
<li>introduces modern statistical computing, and
<li>has lots of real examples.
</ul>

The book is intended as an upper level undergraduate or introductory
graduate textbook in statistical thinking with a likelihood emphasis
for students with a good knowledge of calculus and the ability to
think abstractly.  "Statistical thinking" means a focus on ideas
that statisticians care about as opposed to technical details of how
to put those ideas into practice.  The book does contain technical
details, but they are not the focus.  "Likelihood emphasis"
means that the likelihood function and likelihood principle are
unifying ideas throughout the text.  

<p>
Another unusual aspect is the use of statistical software as a
pedagogical tool.  That is, instead of viewing the computer merely as
a convenient and accurate calculating device, the book uses computer
calculation and simulation as another way of explaining and helping
readers understand the underlying concepts.  The book is written with
the statistical language <B>R</B> embedded throughout.  <B>R</B> and
accompanying manuals are available for free download from <a

review</a> from <B>JASA</B>, December, 2006.

<p>
<B>Introduction to Statistical Thought</B> is not finished, and
probably never will be, but
is sufficiently complete to be used as a course text by knowledgable
instructors.  Material will be added and corrections will be made.  Let
me know your suggestions and any errors you find.  And please let
me hear about your experience reading the book or using it as a text.

<p>
<B>Introduction to Statistical Thought</B> is available for free
download.  Because it is not handled by a commercial publisher, it
will not be advertised as most commercial texts are.  Therefore it
must rely on word of mouth.  If you like it, please let others know.
If you don't like it, please let me know, especially if you can say
why.  I don't promise to adopt your suggestions but I do promise to
take them seriously.
