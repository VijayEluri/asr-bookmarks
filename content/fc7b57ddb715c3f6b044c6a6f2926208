<link rel="Section" href="#This" title="This is tinydns.org" />
<h2 id="This">This is tinydns.org</h2>

<p>Please note that this website is tinydns.org.  It used to be
accessible via djbdns.com or djbdns.org.  The holder of those two
domain names registered them before I could.  For a time, he served up
a frame linking to tinydns.org.  He then let the registration lapse,
and now the usual search page idiots have it.  Thanks, guy.</p>

<p>Note that djbdns is not subject to the DNS vulnerability announced July 8.  From the CERT Advisory: "Daniel J. Bernstein is credited with the original idea and
implementation of randomized source ports in the DNS resolver."</p>

<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>djbdns is a replacement for BIND.  It is secure, reliable, small,
fast, etc etc etc.  Just like all of Dan Bernstein's <a
href="http://cr.yp.to/">tools</a>.  Dan has <a
href="http://cr.yp.to/djbdns.html">his own home page for djbdns</a>.  We've got this one
so we can distribute our enhancements to djbdns.</p>

<p>dnscache is a recursive resolver, intended to be listed in
<samp>/etc/resolv.conf</samp>'s "nameserver" entry.  It makes DNS queries via UDP
and TCP as needed. It imposes restrictions on what it will return;
that's why it was written. It will only provide data obtained from
authoritative servers.  These servers are found via a chain of
delegations from authoritative servers starting from the configured-in
roots. That's part of its security model.  If it were to do anything
less, it would be subject to the same cache-poisoning style attacks
that work on the current insecure DNS servers.</p>

<p>tinydns does authoritative nameserving via UDP only; it does not do
recursive nameserving, nor does it answer TCP queries (axfrdns does
that). The only hosts that should ask tinydns for a host are recursive
nameservers, such as those found in <samp>/etc/resolv.conf</samp>, like djbdns or
BIND.  Tinydns should never be listed in <samp>/etc/resolv.conf</samp>. Tinydns
interoperates properly with every authoritative and recursive
nameserver I know of, and supporting all the standards needed to do
so.</p>

<p>axfrdns does authoritative nameserving via TCP, and is also the zone
transfer server.  The zone transfer client is axfr-get.  Both of these use
Dan Bernstein's ucspi-tcp helpers.  Why separate programs?  To limit
security incursions, and because many sites do not need zone transfers.
As BIND has shown, excessive functionality is a root <!-- sic --> to
security disasters.</p>

<ul>

<li> <p> <strong>2006-03:</strong> <a
href="http://www.isotf.org/news/DNS-Amplification-Attacks.pdf">DNS
amplification attacks</a> are becoming more widespread.  Fortunately,
the default installation of djbdns is immune to these kinds of
attacks.  Tinydns doesn't do any recursive queries, so no
amplification is possible.  Dnscache is not an open resolver by
default.  In order for your dnscache installation to be open to
queries from everyone, you would need to create many files of the form
"#." in /service/dnscache/root/ip/.  Don't do that.

<li> <p> <strong>2003-10:</strong>
<a href="http://homepages.tesco.net./~J.deBoynePollard/FGA/verisign-internet-coup.html">
"All your *.com and *.net are belong to us."</a>
Verisign threatens to corrupt the Domain Name System
again.  Late in the evening of 2003-09-15 they introduced wildcard *.com and
*.net A records into the top-level domain name servers.  They resolved
to 64.94.110.11.  They removed those records, but threaten to
reinstate them.  Russ Nelson has written a patch to <a
href="djbdns-1.05-ignoreip.patch">ignore this IP
address</a>.  Turns out that about a dozen registrars are doing this,
so you can <a href="djbdns-1.05-ignoreip2.patch">ignore multiple IP addresses</a>.
Note that .name uses wildcard records legitimately, and so may some of
the other registrars, e.g. the contract for .museum specifies that
*.museum is expected.  The trouble with Verisign is that their
contract does not.</p>

<p>A few people have contributed enhancements:</p>

<h3 id="ContributedPackages">Packages</h3>

<ul>

<li>Mate Wierdl has an <a

does <a href="http://dustman.net/andy/djbware/">Andy Dustman</a>.

<li>Gerrit Pape has <a
href="http://smarden.org/pape/Debian/">Debian packages</a>.

</ul>

<h3 id="ContributedRRTypes">Convenience tools for various resource record types</h3>

<p>
djbdns supports all possible resource record types with a generic syntax.
</p>

<ul>

<li>Rob Mayoff provides
<a href="http://dqd.com/~mayoff/tools/djbdns/make-record.adp">
a tool for generating SRV records and RP records</a>
in the djbdns generic record syntax.

<li>Michael Handler wrote a <a href="srv-patch">SRV patch</a>, which
lets tinydns-data and axfr-get work natively with SRV records.  This
patch also has a work-around for BIND's improper compression of PTR
records.

<li>Interested in DNS-LOC (inserting your location into your DNS)?
djbdns <a href="dns-loc.html">supports DNS-LOC</a>.

<li>Dan Peterson needed to <a
href="http://danp.net/djbdns/tinydns-data-soa-contact.patch">set a SOA
contact address</a> other than what tinydns-data sets, so he wrote a
new data file record type, 'D'.  It defines the contact address to be used for all
subsequent records.  An empty contact address means that tinydns-data
should resume manufacturing a contact address.
<span style="background-color: silver">
Note, should you
happen to care about such things: This record creates a
context that prevents you from re-ordering the 'data' file.
</span>
<span style="background-color: silver">
Also note that Dan now recommends simply using a pre-processor to generate 'Z' lines instead.
</span>

<li>Guilherme Balena Versiani has added support for <a
href="http://mywebpage.netscape.com/guibv/">SRV+NAPTR</a>.

<li>Anders Brownworth wants SRV and NAPTR records without patching
djbdns, so he wrote a web page that <a
href="http://www.anders.com/projects/sysadmin/djbdnsRecordBuilder/">builds
generic SRV/NAPTR</a> records.

<li>Thomas Mangin has a simple code sipset to <a

href="http://www.jms1.net/djbdns/rbldns-patch.html">per-record
IP/TXT</a> information.

<li>Jonathan de Boyne Pollard has written
<a href="http://homepages.tesco.net./~J.deBoynePollard/Softwares/djbdns/#content-alias-chain-truncation">
a patch to make tinydns and axfrdns publish complete CNAME answers</a>,
in the way that other DNS server softwares do and that RFC 1034 describes.

<li>"Mrs. Brisby" has written <a
href="http://www.nimh.org/code/ldapdns/">ldapdns</a>.  ldapdns is a tool that
gateways dns requests (which used to use a djbdns backend but no
longer does) to a nearby ldap server.  It requires djbdns and openldap.
<span style="background-color: silver">
Note this is <em>not</em> ldap2dns, or even similar (except in name).
ldap2dns works in tandem with tinydns, whereas with ldapdns, queries are
answered based on LIVE information in the ldap server.
Neither is it tinyldap (which is an LDAP server, not a DNS server).
</span>

<li>Gerrit Pape has a simply updated dynamic DNS solution, called <a
href="http://smarden.org/tinydyndns/">tinydyndns</a>, which updates a
DNS name whenever you check mail in a POP3 mailbox.

<li>Bob Vincent wrote <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tinyddns/">tinyddns</a>, which
uses a client and server architecture for updating tinydns dynamically.

<ul>

<li>Uwe Ohse has a patch to <a
href="http://www.ohse.de/uwe/patches/dnscache-0.61.okclient.patch">allow
any client</a> to access DNScache.  He also has a patch to get <a
href="http://www.ohse.de/uwe/patches/djbdns-1.05-dnsfilter-replace.diff">dnsfilter
replace the IP address by the hostname</a>.  He also has a patch to
cause tinydns to <a
href="http://www.ohse.de/uwe/patches/djbdns-1.05-multiip.diff">bind to
multiple IP addresses</a>.

<li>Dan Peterson has a patch for dnscache so it can <a
href="http://danp.net/djbdns/dnscache-multiple-ip.patch">bind to
multiple IP addresses</a> and serve queries on those IP addresses from
the same cache.

<li>Matthias Andree has instructions on how to force dnscache to
timeout if you have a <a
href="http://home.pages.de/~mandree/dialup/djbdns.html">transient
(aka dialup) Internet connection</a>.

<li>Florent Guillaume has a patch to dnscache which lets you <a
href="http://efge.free.fr//djbdns/">save and
load</a> the cache.

<li>Nikola Vladov has written <a
href="http://riemann.fmi.uni-sofia.bg/docs/djbdns-dumpcache.html">djbdns-dumpcache</a>,
which dumps and reloads the cache periodically, by way of finding the
best cachesize.

<li>Thomas Mangin has a <a
href="http://thomas.mangin.com/#tag:link_djbdns_loadbalancing_patch">round-robin
patch</a> for dnscache.
<span style="background-color: silver">
Note that this is for dnscache, not tinydns.
</span>
Jonathan de Boyne Pollard has written
<a href="http://homepages.tesco.net./~J.deBoynePollard/FGA/dns-round-robin-is-useless.html">
an explanation of why this almost certainly won't do what you really want</a>.

<li>Laurent G. Bercot has a <a href="http://www.skarnet.org/software/djbdns-fwdzone/">patch to
djbdns</a> to allow dnscache to resolve a name or forward it depending
on the zone of the query.

<li>Russ Nelson has written a patch to <a href="djbdns-1.05-ignoreip2.patch">convert given A responses into
NXDOMAIN</a>.  This helps with registrars that improperly insert
wildcard records (*cough* Verisign *cough*).

<li>The list of ICANN's root servers that comes with djbdns
is out of date.  Jonathan de Boyne Pollard has written
<a href="http://homepages.tesco.net./~J.deBoynePollard/FGA/dns-updating-resolving-proxy-root-list.html#djbdns">
instructions on how to bring this list up to date</a>.

<li> The Open Root Server Confederation has a page on <a
href="http://support.open-rsc.org./How_To/unix/djbdns/">configuring
djbdns</a> to work with its root servers and thus to enable use of the augmented
root.

<li>Jonathan de Boyne Pollard has written
<a href="http://homepages.tesco.net./~J.deBoynePollard/Softwares/djbdns/#dnscache-strict-forwardonly">
a patch to prevent dnscache encountering loops in ${FORWARDONLY} mode</a>.

<li>Jonathan de Boyne Pollard has written
<a href="http://homepages.tesco.net./~J.deBoynePollard/Softwares/djbdns/#dnscacheip-space-separator">
a patch to allow a more useful separator character in the ${DNSCACHEIP} environment variable</a>
that the dns library in djbdns uses.

<li>Jonathan de Boyne Pollard has written
<a href="http://homepages.tesco.net./~J.deBoynePollard/Softwares/djbdns/#dnsqrx">
dnsqrx</a>, which performs the task of dnsqr but allows one to explicitly specify the target server
to be queried, like dnsq.

<li>Jonathan de Boyne Pollard has written
<a href="http://homepages.tesco.net./~J.deBoynePollard/Softwares/djbdns/#dnsnamex">
a patch to add a dnsnamex command to djbdns</a>, which prints <em>all</em> of the names that an
IP address maps to, instead of just the first one like dnsname does.

<li>Jonathan de Boyne Pollard has written
<a href="http://homepages.tesco.net./~J.deBoynePollard/Softwares/djbdns/#dcache-cname-handling">
a patch to dnscache that improves its handling of CNAME resource records</a>.

<li>djbdns is more than just a dnscache and a tinydns authoritative
server.  It also has a dns client library.  Luca Morettoni has written
<a href="http://morettoni.net/qmail-rblchk.en.html">qmail-rblchk</a>,
which uses the DJB library for DNS query.  It's a good example for
using the dns client library.

</ul>

<h3 id="ContributedXFR">Database replication via the "Zone transfer" mechanism</h3>

<ul>

<li>Jos Backus wrote a dnsnotify program to send out BIND notify
messages.  James Raftery
<a href="dnsnotify">modified it</a> to notify all
servers, and set the AA bit.  It takes a zone and a list of slave
addresses, builds a NOTIFY request and sends it to each of the slaves,
printing the result. This in turn will cause each slave to do a SOA
lookup and serial number comparison, followed by a zone transfer if
the serial number has changed.  Further, Andrew Pam modified it to
create <a
href="http://www.sericyb.com.au/tinydns-notify">tinydns-notify</a>, in
order to be able to send "NOTIFY" messages only to his slaves that are
running BIND, and only when their zones have changed.  Brad Peczka has further modified it for machines with <a href="http://bradpeczka.com/code/tinydns-notify">multiple IP addresses</a>.

<li>If you don't  have perl or NET::DNS,  you  may want  to use Joseph
Tam's <a  href="http://www.math.ubc.ca/~tam/Software/dns-notify">dns-notify</a>
program, written in C.

<li>Luca Morettoni wrote <a
href="http://morettoni.net/bsd/zonenotify-0.1.tar.gz">zonenotify</a>,
which is a notify sender written in C.

<li>Matt Armstrong wrote <a
href="http://www.lickey.com/autoaxfr/">autoaxfr</a>.  It wraps
axfr-get to read a control file.

<li>Russ Nelson wrote <a href="axfr">axfr</a>.  Axfr builds tinydns's
data file from a combination of single-zone files beginning with
primary, and subdirectories of secondaried files beginning with axfr.
The name of the subdirectory is the IP address of the primary.  Chris
K. Young wrote a <a
href="http://www.kernel-panic.org/~cky/axfr/axfr.1">man page</a>.
Sean Hunter suggests add-* scripts of the following form:
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
[ -f primary.$1 ] || touch primary.$1
exec /usr/local/bin/tinydns-edit primary.$1 temp/primary.$1.new add alias ${1+"$@"}
</pre>

<li>Russ Nelson also wrote <a href="update-domains">update-domains</a>, which
works with the axfr program to allow a DNS peer to publish their list
of secondary domains on a web page.  He uses it in a crontab owned by tinydns like this:
<pre>
20 4 * * * cd root/217.160.170.133; http@ www.fte.to crynwr.txt | /usr/local/bin/update-domains
</pre>

<li>John R Levine wrote <a href="http://www.iecc.com/dnsrefresh">dnsrefresh</a>, a perl script
that provides BIND style zone updates by looking at the refresh time
and zone serials.  It's useful when your primary insists on runing
BIND.

<li>Luc Pardon has instructions to make <a href="http://www.fefe.de/dns/djbdns-1.05-ixfr.diff.gz"> axfrdns work
with BIND9 slaves who use IXFR</a>.

<li>John Gateley transfers zone files directly using a <a
href="http://www.jfoo.net/jfooxfer.shtml">perl script</a> that handles
split horizon elegantly.

</ul>

<h3 id="ContributedMisc">Miscellaneous contributions</h3>

<ul>

<li>Felix von Leitner has three packages
<ul>
<li>An <a href="http://www.fefe.de/dns/">ipv6 patch</a> for djbdns.
<li>An <a href="http://www.fefe.de/ucspi/">ipv6 patch</a> for ucspi-tcp (for axfr).
<li>His <a href="http://www.fefe.de/djb/">libdjb</a> packages up Dan's libraries.
</ul>

<li>Jul has written a <a href="http://js.hu./package/djbdns-conf.html">configuration tool</a>.

<li>Lennert Buytenhek wrote a patch that causes tinydns to keep its
mmap() of the data.cdb file open for at <a
href="one-second.patch">most one second</a>, instead of the default
one hundred queries.

<li>Johnny Halfmoon has a binary <a href="http://milksnot.com/joomla/unix/djbdns-for-openwrt">package for OpenWRT</a>.

<h2 id="Patches">Recommended patches</h2>

<ul>

<li>The definitions of errno in djbdns (and tcpserver)
do not work with the newest glibc (2.3.1).  Debian and redhat are
updating to this glibc.  Executables compiled with older glibc's (2.3)
abort on startup, and recompilation with 2.3.1 is not possible.  Mate
Wierdl has <a href="http://moni.csi.hu/pub/glibc-2.3.1/">patches</a> for some
of djb's softwares.  The specific patch for djbdns is also
<a href="djbdns-errno.patch">here</a>.
Erwin Hoffmann points out that
<a href="http://qmail.org/top.html#200403160">a one-line sed script</a>
will fix most of DJB's software.

<li>TCP queries have the potential to cause dnscache to catch a
SIGPIPE if the remote side closes the socket before the write
finishes.  This causes dnscache to exit.  There is a trivial <a
href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=djbdns&m=104812086607532&w=2">patch</a>
[<a
href="marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=djbdns&m=104812086607532&w=2">local</a>]
which causes djbdns to ignore SIGPIPE.
