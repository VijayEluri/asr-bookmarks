                            Monit is a free open source utility for managing

                            filesystems on a UNIX system. Monit conducts
                            automatic maintenance and repair and can execute
                            meaningful causal actions in error situations.

                            <h3 class="no-outline">What Monit can do</h3>
                            
                            <p>Monit can start a process if it does not run,
                            restart a process if it does not respond and stop
                            a process if it uses too much resources. You can
                            use Monit to monitor files, directories and
                            filesystems for changes, such as timestamp
                            changes, checksum changes or size changes. You can
                            also monitor remote hosts; Monit can ping a remote
                            host and can check TCP/IP port connections and
                            server protocols. Monit is controlled via an easy
                            to use control file based on a free-format,
                            token-oriented syntax. Monit logs to syslog or to
                            its own log file and notifies you about error
                            conditions and recovery status via customizable
                            alert.</p>

                            <h3 class="no-outline">Design philosophy</h3>
                            <p>It is important for a system monitoring tool to
                            just work - all the time and you should be able to
                            trust it to do so. A system monitoring tool need
                            to be non-intrusive and you should be able to
                            forget about it once it's installed. That is,
                            until sshd dies on your co-located server, 50
                            miles away. When this happens, it is good to know
                            that you have installed this extra layer of
                            security and protection - just wait a few seconds
                            and Monit will restart the sshd daemon. It is also
                            helpful to get an alert mail before the server
                            disks are full or if your http server suddenly is
                            slashdotted.</p>

                            <p>Monit is designed as an autonomous system and does
                            not depend on plugins nor any special libraries to
                            run. Instead it works right out of the box and can
                            utilize existing infrastructure already on your
                            system. For instance, Monit will easily integrate
                            with init and can use existing runlevel rc-scripts
                            to manage services. There are also flexibility for
                            those special cases when you need a certain setup
                            for a service.</p>

                            <p>Monit compiles and run on most flavors of UNIX. It
                            is a small program and weights in at just over
                            300kB. There is support for compiling with glibc
                            replacements such as uClibc if you need it to be
                            even smaller.</p>

                            <h3 class="no-outline">Check server status with a
                            Web Browser</h3> <p>Monit provides a built-in
                            HTTP(S) interface and you can use a browser to
                            access the Monit server. Check out the <a
