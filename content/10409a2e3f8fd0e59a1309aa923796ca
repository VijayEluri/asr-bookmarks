                <h2>Announcement from June 10, 2010</h2>

                <p>You may have noticed that we&#8217;ve been a bit quiet lately. It&#8217;s not that we&#8217;ve been on vacation; rather we can finally announce today that <strong>our company, Smallthought Systems, has been acquired. We&#8217;re joining forces with our friends at <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>.</strong></p>

                <p>Obviously this represents a new chapter in the life of Dabble DB, both for us as a team, and for the product itself. We&#8217;d like to assure you that, for now, we will continue to provide our software and technical support to current Dabble DB customers. However, we will be disabling new account signups effective immediately.</p>

                <p>There will be further changes to Dabble&#8217;s ongoing operations, and when those happen, we want to do right by you. We will provide you with 60 days advance notice of any major change. We will do whatever we need to do to make sure that, at any time, you can export all of your data, including attachments, in a structured format suitable for import into other systems.</p>

        <p>
            <strong>Is this the end of Dabble DB?</strong>
        </p>
<!-- 
        <p>
            No. We will be working with Twitter to release Dabble DB as an open source product, to help ensure the long-term success of the platform. &ldquo;Open source&rdquo; means that the code used to write Dabble DB will become freely available forever, so others may provide services based on Dabble DB and even improve it. It also means that individuals and companies may operate Dabble DB on their own servers.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li class="q2">
        <p>
            <strong>How long will Dabble DB continue to exist?</strong>
        </p>
 -->
        <p>
            No. Operation of both the service and technical support will continue as usual until further notice, with the exception that we will no longer be accepting new sign-ups for accounts. In the event that we terminate the service, we will provide our customers with at least 60 days advance notice. We will also do everything we can to help customers transition their data elsewhere if necessary.
        </p>

    <li class="q2">
        <p>
            <strong>Can I still create new database accounts?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            No.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li class="q1">
        <p>
            <strong>Can I still invite new users and add applications to my existing account?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Yes. Existing accounts will continue to function the same. You may add or remove users and applications as you need.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li class="q2">
        <p>
            <strong>What is the refund policy if I no longer wish to use the service?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Our refund policy remains the same. Customers may cancel at any time, but we do not issue refunds for either monthly or yearly customers. Should we terminate the service, we will refund yearly customers pro-rata.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li class="q1">
        <p>
            <strong>Can I pay you more money to keep working on Dabble DB?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Sorry, no.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li class="q2">
        <p>
            <strong>What about new features?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            We will no longer be developing new features for Dabble DB. We will archive the list of popular feature requests so that if and when Dabble DB is operated by others, they may pick up where we left off.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li class="q1">
        <p>
            <strong>What about bugs?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            We will fix critical bugs as needed to ensure the software remains stable and fully operational.
