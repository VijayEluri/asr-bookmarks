Ranked queries are used to locate relevant documents in text
databases.
In a ranked query a list of terms is specified, then the documents
that most closely match the query are returned---in decreasing order
of similarity---as answers.
Crucial to the efficacy of ranked querying is the use of a similarity
heuristic, a mechanism that assigns a numeric score
indicating how closely a document and the query match.
In this note we explore and categorise a range of similarity
heuristics described in the literature.
We have implemented all of these measures in a structured way, and
have carried out retrieval experiments with a substantial subset of
these measures.

Our purpose with this work is threefold: first, in enumerating the
various measures in an orthogonal framework we make it
straightforward for other researchers to describe and discuss
similarity measures; second, by experimenting with a wide range of
the measures, we hope to observe which features yield good retrieval
behaviour in a variety of retrieval environments; and third, by
describing our results so far, to gather feedback on the issues we
have uncovered.
We demonstrate that it is surprisingly
difficult to identify which techniques work best, and comment on the
experimental methodology required to support any claims as to the
superiority of one method over another.
