said:
In general, the people that took the survey are
very happy with Varnish. This is not
really surprising - if they weren't they would
never have heard of it.

Most important feature
It seems performance is still our number one feature - with 52%
indicating it as the most important feature. ESI seems to be
growing in popularity, almost 10% indicates it as the most
important feature.
Personally my favorite feature is the flexibility of VCL. The massive amount of features I've seen implemented in Varnish over the last 4 years in VCL without us planning for them says something.
Starting with Varnish is relatively hardThis was somewhat expected. After
all, Varnish is a very different program. Most users
aren't that familiar with shared memory logging, VCL and management
over a telnet interface when they first start out with Varnish.
Hopefully, we'll find ways of making it easier. We've got some hints in the comments on what is needed.
What tools are people using?
The first surprise was that only
34% use varnishncsa. The rest seem to rely on other tools, like
Google Analytics or just don't care about logging.
Furthermore, good to see that someone uses varnishreplay. Only 5
people indicated that they do, but that counts for something. For
those who don't know what it is - varnishreplay can
replay traffic recorded with varnishlog. It's good
for keeping the caches on your backup site hot or for doing load
testing with real traffic. When I was a sysadmin doing web stuff I really wished for such a feature and I've spent hours and hours of my life implementing perl-hacks to emulate this in one way or another.

Debian Linux seem to be the most popular platform out there. I was
a bit surprised to see Debian being so popular. I thought the Ubuntu LTS releases where going to gain a lot of territory from Debian in the server rooms due to the long support cycle.
Also, Centos seems to be twice as popular as RHEL.
Also FreeBSD seems to be about as popular as RHEL, with about 10%
each of our users. Go FreeBSD!
Others are some SLES and OpenSuse users and
some enthusiastic OpenBSD users. :-)
 
Rotating hard drives
are still very popular with 83% of our users using it for
Varnish. 10% are already on solid state with 12% planning to switch
to SSD real soon now. The future is obviously stored on a SSD drive.
Stevedores

62% use -s file, which I find somewhat surprising. -s file
doesn't really perform that well under pressure on rotating hard
drives due to some changes in recent Linux and FreeBSD
kernels. It is, however, the default. A whopping 7% run -s
persistent even without the working LRU. We really appreciate the
effort, people. Thank you.
 
Load balancing
About half of you use Varnish for load balancing. Out of these
7% (of the total) use a two-layer coating of Varnish. That is, you're
using Varnish as a load balancer in front of Varnish. For the last
6 month this is Varnish Softwares primary way of installing
Varnish when there isn't a load balancer present. I lot of the time someone has already sunk a load of money into a load balancer and so we're force to use it. :-)

 
What sucks?

The documentation is still an issue. A full reference guide is
still not underway, we don't have the resources for that and
Varnish is still somewhat of a moving target. However, some sort of
a official cookbook was asked for - and this should be doable. With
recipes for common use-cases and such. A lot of the content is already in the Wiki, we just need to organize it and clean it up.
The source code naming is a bit terse and some of you find reading the code a bit hard. Old habits die
hard and back in the days characters where very expensive. :-)
No gzip with ESI. Yes, we know. A resolution is coming in 3.0
or soon thereafter.
Solaris support is not so good. Oracle acquiring Sun didn't help. Some users reported migrating to Linux and found the whole migration experience very pleasant. I'm personally considering Solaris a dieing platform.
Hitpass is a difficult concept and can sometimes be a bit dangerous. Especially for those of you who are running with long TTLs.
Cookie handling is awkward.

Other comments

One killer point about varnish is that it is *much* better at
protecting backends than Akamai. The actual deployment procedure
and backend relief expected in comparison is remarkable, and is in
my opinion an Akamai killer!
Keep up the good work. After 6 years being a fulltime
administrator of approx 800 servers, varnish is the greatest piece
of software I encountered. One can see *BSD background in its
design ;-)
I would like more ringtones and apps
(this one is my favorite!)
Varnish has been awesome aside from the initial solaris issues.
I love Varnish. I'll do whatever I can to contribute.
Varnish is one of the best pieces of software I've ever used.
I love your work!!!   We replaced 14 squid servers with two varnish caches and have headroom for days :)
Rock on!I was thinking of having a follow-up or two looking somewhat deeper into the dataset and see if we can see if there are any correlations between platform, stevedore and happiness. If anyone would like to have the whole set let me know, I'll remove the email addresses and let you have it.

                <span class="field-content">Virtual hosts are built into Varnish Cache. In fact they are so deeply built into it that sometimes it's a bit hard to actually figure out how it works. For Varnish an URL is an URL, whatever the host is. So, if you want to have special configuration based on what the host, either virtual or IP-based, is you have to write special configuration to do so.
 
Yesterday, Michael Alger, posted to the varnish-misc list with a good pattern on how to organize your VCL according to the host. The idea is simple, first lets take a look at IP-based configuration. Basically you put each configuration in one file and then you do if-elsif that include one file for each host. Like this:
 if (server.ip == "10.22.152.11")
 {
   include "/etc/varnish/site-something.com.vcl";
 }
 elsif (server.ip == "10.22.152.25")
 {
   include "/etc/varnish/site-somethingelse.com.vcl";
 }
 elsif (server.ip == "10.22.152.21")
 {
   include "/etc/varnish/site-anotherthing.com.vcl";
 }

For name-based virtual hosting, you'll probably want to first sanitise the host header (remove or add ":80" suffix, remove or add "www." prefix) and then include a site configuration based on the hostname requested:
 
if (! req.http.Host)
 {
   error 404 "Need a host header";
 }
 set req.http.Host = regsub(req.http.Host, "^www\.", "");
 set req.http.Host = regsub(req.http.Host, ":80$", "");

 if (req.http.Host == "something.com")
 {
   include "/etc/varnish/site-something.com.vcl";
 }
 elsif (req.http.Host == "somethingelse.com")
 {
   include "/etc/varnish/site-somethingelse.com.vcl";
 }

Thanks to for Michael Alger for his informative post.

                <span class="field-content">a huggy bear monster that tucks you in at night or something to give you real nightmares?The ban lurker is an often overlooked feature of Varnish, mostly because it is off by default. It can help you keep a clean cache, by scaring seldom accessed objects with long TTLs out into the open. Here they can be executed humanly by Varnish's flexible ban purging mechanism. These little critters would otherwise hide in the corners until their TTLs expired.
Varnish features two different ways of getting rid of stale content. The direct purge is done through VCL rules, which would match an object directly through it's hashed value, and setting the TTL to zero. The object would be removed from the cache immediatly. The other mechanism we call bans, and are more flexible in that they can contain regular expressions over their URLs and headers, and match against entire trees of URLs. But these bans are not executed directly, rather objects are matched against them when they are looked up, and removed at that time if they match.

In the case of seldom accessed objects with long TTLs, these objects could never be banned and take up valuable cache space until their TTL expire. This is where the ban lurker can help you, by actively walking the cache and matching objects against the ban list. You enable it by setting the 'ban_lurker_sleep' parameter of Varnish to some value other than zero. The parameter controls for how long it will sleep between each object found to be banned.

Remember the name is no disgrace, the ban lurker has real value dispite it's unfortunate name.

With hopes of sweet dreams and no nightmares,

                <span class="field-content">Today I learned that Wikileaks is a Varnish Cache user.

To quote WikiLeaks:
In its landmark ruling on the Pentagon Papers, the US Supreme Court ruled that "only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government."
I too agree. The suppression of free-speech and freedom of press has given a the public an excuse to turn a blind eye to the various misconducts and blatant injustices from governments of the world. WikiLeaks promotes international readership by working closely with other publishing houses through sharing news. By working in such a manner, governments are scrutinised by both their own audience and the audience of the world. 
 
For the last years the disruptive effect of various open source products has granted any organization, big or small, the tools to host content and serve it to a global audience. One single server can, thanks to tools like Linux, Varnish, Drupal and MySQL (or any of their respective alternatives) create a site able to handle thousands of requests per second.
If that's not a win for freedom of speech I don't know what is!
