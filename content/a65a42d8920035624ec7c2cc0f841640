Despite a bad                     start, I caught the start-up bug. In the years since, I have                     worked with more than 30 start-ups as founder, advisor, engineer,                     executive, and board member. It's a lot more than that if                     you count all the times I've tried to help "nerd" friends                     (engineers) connect with the "rich guys" (VCs). Naturally,                     I've formed opinions along the way. Many books and articles                     eulogize VCs. But here I want to present an engineer's view                     of VCs. It may sound like I'm maligning VCs. That's not my                     intent. And I'm not trying to change human nature. VCs know                     how to deal with engineers, but engineers don't know how to                     deal with VCs. VCs take advantage of this situation to maximize                     the return for the venture fund's investors. Engineers are                     getting short-changed. </font>                   <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fortunately,                     engineers are trained problem-solvers--I want to harness that                     power. Engineers, armed with better information about how                     VCs operate, can work for more equitable solutions. I'm not                     offering detailed solutions--that would be a book. Rather,                     this is a wake-up call for engineers.</font>                   <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My first                     experience with VCs was as an engineer starting a microprocessor-design                     company; VCs were the gods of money. The other founders and                     I told the VCs what we thought we could do and how long it                     would take. We believed it; they believed it; we were all                     naive. I had designed two microprocessors, had written a textbook                     on the topic, and had taught at a well-known university. They                     thought I knew what I was talking about. We landed money from                     premiere firms on Sand Hill Road in Palo Alto, Calif. We told                     them a year; it took something like seven years and it took                     major changes in strategy to get there.</font>                   <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I wasn't                     the CEO; I hired and managed the engineering teams that eventually                     reached the goal. I wasn't there for the finish. I had a run-in                     with the other founders, including the CEO, over how to manage                     engineers. It was micromanagement versus laissez faire. (Their                     attitude: "Turn your back on them and they'll sit on their                     hands." My attitude: "Turn these particular engineers loose                     and they'll work themselves to physical ruin.") We were in                     danger of losing good engineers to morale problems. I suggested                     to the board that firing all of the founders, including me,                     might solve the problem. A new team might manage more consistently.</font>                   <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The board                     member from our largest VC firm invited me to his house in                     Woodside for a chat about the morale problems. Acres, opulence,                     wealth. We sat in leather chairs on a black marble floor.                     Behind him, through the glass wall, I saw major excavation                     and construction work going on up the hillside.

One case was                     blatant theft--sections of the original business plan were                     crudely copied and taped into the VC-sponsored plan. My friend                     sued and won a moral victory and a little money. The start-up                     based on the stolen idea went public and made lots of money                     for that start-up's VCs. Most entrepreneurs don't have the                     time, the means, or the proof to sue.

Pricing sets the number of shares and the value                     of a share, and is typically expressed in a "term sheet" from                     the VC to the start-up. VCs optimize locally.

Here's my summary of the VC's view:</font>                   <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"A year                     ago there was too much money available, so there was too much                     competition to fund good ideas. Valuations for pre-IPO (initial                     public offering) start-ups were too high. Start-ups could                     get term sheets from several venture firms and select the                     most favorable. Too many ideas were getting funded. With too                     many rivals, markets might never develop. The current market                     is much better. Valuations are reasonable and, with few rivals                     in each sector, new markets will develop--as they might not                     have with many rivals." </font>                   <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This                     is nonsense. Look, for example, at hard disks and floppy disks.                     In the hard-disk business, there have been as many as 41 rivals                     fighting for market share. Only three major manufacturers                     competed in floppy disks. The hard disk has improved much                     faster technically; the floppy disk is stagnant by comparison.                     I'm not talking about market size or market opportunity (the                     hard-disk business versus the floppy-disk business); I'm talking                     about rates of innovation. </font>                   <p>                   <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="669933"><b>VCs                     don't say no.</b></font> <br>                    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If the                     VC is interested, you can expect a call and, eventually, a                     check.

Just like Julia Roberts                     and Tom Cruise, the superstar CEOs command big bucks and big                     percentages (of equity)--driving up the cost of the start-up--but                     are "worth it" because they give investors and VCs a sense                     of security.</font>                   <p>                   <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="669933"><b>Your                     idea, your work, their company. </b></font> <br>                    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The VC's                     CEO gets 10 percent of the company. VC-placed board members                     get 1 percent each. Your entire technical team gets as much                     as 15 percent. Venture firms get the rest. Subsequent funding                     rounds lower ("dilute") the amount owned by the technical                     team. Venture firms control the board seats. The VC on your                     board sits on 11 other boards. Board members visit once a                     month or once a quarter, listen to the start-up's executives,                     make demands, offer suggestions, and collect personal stock                     options greater than all of the company's engineers hold,                     with the possible exceptions of the chief technology officer                     and the vice president of engineering. The VC's executives                     control the company. You and the rest of the engineers do                     the work.</font>                   <h4>                     <p align="left">                     <hr size=1 noshade>                    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="3366FF"><b>VCs                     take advantage...to maximize the return for the venture fund's                     investors. Engineers are getting short-changed. </b></font>                     <hr size=1 noshade>                  </h4>                  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One company                     I know got a good valuation a year ago. Over the year, it                     grew rapidly, developed its product, met or exceeded its milestones,                     and spent its money according to plan. When it was time to                     get money again, the funding environment had changed. Last                     year's main investor wouldn't "price" the shares or "lead"                     the new funding round. The "price" declares the number of                     shares and the valuation of the company. Think of the company                     as a pie. It is a certain size (valuation) and it is cut into                     a number of slices (shares). An investor "leads" by offering                     a specific price for shares for a large percentage of the                     next round. Other investors follow at the same price. Even                     though the company's engineers had executed flawlessly, the                     round came in at less than a third of last year's valuation.</font>                   <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a                     part of closing this "down" round, the last year's investors                     renegotiated the previous round, effectively saying, "Since                     this round is lower, we must have overpaid in the last round.                     We want more equity for the last investment." If there had                     been fraud by the entrepreneurs instead of flawless execution,                     renegotiating the previous round might have been reasonable.                     Imagine the opposite scenario: "In light of market developments,                     it's obvious that your idea is worth much more than we thought,                     so we're returning half the equity we took for last year's                     funding." It's so ridiculously improbable that you can't read                     it without laughing out loud. That we accept the converse                     highlights the entrepreneur's weak position.</font>                   <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="669933"><b>Values                     at variance</b></font> <br>                    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The VCs                     know money and they don't care about the technology; the entrepreneurs                     know technology and they need money. Money knowledge applies                     across all the start-ups; the technical knowledge is unique                     to each. The VCs don't care about any single technology because                     they spread their investments across the opportunities. Knowing                     money isn't the same as knowing value. A year ago, VCs were                     lining up to give money to Internet dog-food companies; this                     year, they wouldn't back an inventor with a working Star Trek                     transporter.</font>                   <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It's                     financial; it's not technical or personal. To the VC, the                     engineer and the ideas are commodities. The venture firm squeezes                     the technical team because it can. VCs believe that they are                     exercising their responsibility to maximize return for themselves                     and for the fund's investors.</font>                   <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reducing                     the engineers' share of the pie is counterproductive, however:                     they become demoralized; productivity suffers; eventually,                     they leave. Engineers are not commodities. Replacing a chip                     designer one year into a complex design delays the project                     six months while the replacement engineer learns and then                     redesigns the work-in-progress.</font>                   <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">VCs don't                     appreciate that the electronics revolution is built on the                     backs and brains of engineers, not of executives. Moore's                     law and engineering talent drive the electronics revolution.                     Tremendous market pull for its products builds momentum. The                     pull is so great that the revolution is indifferent to the                     talents and decisions of its executives (legendary blundering                     causes only ripples), but it depends on the talent and the                     work of its engineers. The engineers are the creators of wealth;                     the VCs are the beneficiaries.</font>                   <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="669933"><b>Fixing                     the problem</b></font> <br>                    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The engineers                     building the future deserve a fair equity share in the value                     they create; today they don't get one. For them to get their                     share, wealthy engineers must fund start-ups. And they don't                     have to be Bill Gates to do so. "Qualified investors" can                     participate in pre-IPO funding. This means your net worth                     (exclusive of your home) must be at least a million dollars                     or you must meet minimum annual income requirements. These                     days, the millionaire's club isn't all that exclusive. Many                     engineers are qualified investors. </font>                   <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you                     are a qualified investor, participate in start-ups as an "angel"                     investor. An angel investor participates in early or "seed"                     funding rounds. Don't do it with more money than you can afford                     to lose, however, because it is risky. To change the situation                     I'm describing, start-ups need your money and they need your                     advice. More money and more start-ups bring faster progress                     and create more wealth. Creating wealth isn't only about money;                     it's about quality of life and it's about raising the standard                     of living for everyone (but that's another essay).</font>                   <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Engineers                     should band together to form venture funds. Start-ups need                     more angel funding and they need better-organized angel funding.                     I'd like to see a dozen or so $100 million venture funds run                     by nerds. These nerd-based venture firms would work at the                     seed round and at the next funding round (called the A round).                     They provide initial funding and advice and they, with the                     benefit of professional financial advice, represent their                     start-ups in future funding negotiations with traditional                     venture firms.</font>                   <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here's                     a third suggestion. I'd like to see an engineer-run start-up                     whose goal is to raise $100 million in a public offering.                     The money becomes a fund for sponsoring start-ups. It's a                     public venture firm and it sells shares to raise money. Investing                     in start-ups wouldn't be exclusively for rich people; anyone                     who could buy stock could be investing in start-ups. Ideally,                     the public VC firm would be managed and run by nerds with                     empathy for nerds in the start-ups.</font>                   <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I wanted                     to publicly thank more than a dozen people for help on this                     essay, but they all said "NO!" None can afford to have the                     VCs find out that they contributed. </font>                   <hr NOSHADE size=1>                  <p align="RIGHT"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica,
